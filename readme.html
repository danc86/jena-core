<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Jena is a Java framework for writing Semantic Web applications.&nbsp; It 
features:</p>

<dl>
<dt>An RDF API</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
  <li>statement centric methods for manipulating an RDF model as a set of RDF
    triples</li>
  <li>resource centric methods for manipulating an RDF model as a set of
    resources with properties</li>
  <li>cascading method calls for more convenient programming</li>
  <li>built in support for RDF containers - bag, alt and seq</li>
  <li>enhanced resources - the application can extend the behaviour of
    resources</li>
  <li>integrated parsers and writers for RDF/XML (ARP), N3 and N-TRIPLES</li>
  <li>support for typed literals</li>
</ul></dd>
  <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
<dt>ARP - Jena's RDF/XML Parser</dt>
  <dd>ARP aims to be fully compliant with the latest decisions of the RDF Core 
  WG. The Jena 2.0 version is compliant with the Editor's Working Drafts at time 
  of release. ARP is typically invoked using Jena's read operations, but can 
  also be used standalone.</dd>
<dd>&nbsp;</dd>
  <dt>Persistence</dt>
  <dd>The Jena2 persistence subsystem implements an extension to the Jena Model 
  class that provides persistence for models through use of a back-end database 
  engine. Jena2 is largely backwards-compatible for Jena1 applications with the 
  exception of some database configuration options. The default Jena2 database 
  layout uses a denormalized schema in which literals and resource URIs are 
  stored directly in statement tables. This differs from Jena1 in which all 
  literals and resources were stored in common tables that were referenced by 
  statements. Thus, the Jena2 layout enables faster insertion and retrieval but 
  uses more storage than Jena1. Configuration options are available that give 
  Jena2 users some control over the degree of denormalization in order to reduce 
  storage consumption.</dd>
<dd>&nbsp;</dd>
  <dd>
  The persistence subsystem supports a Fastpath capability for RDQL queries that 
  dynamically generates SQL queries to perform as much of the RDQL query as 
  possible within an SQL database engine. Currently, Jena2 can use three SQL 
  database engines, MySQL, Oracle and PostgreSQL. These are supported on Linux 
  and WindowsXP. As with Jena1, the persistence subsystem is designed to be 
  portable to other SQL database engines.</dd>
<dd>&nbsp;</dd>
    <dt><b>Reasoning Subsystem</b></dt>
    <dd>The Jena2 reasoner subsystem includes a generic rule based inference
      engine together with configured rule sets for RDFS and for the OWL/Lite subset of OWL Full.
      These reasoners can be used to construct <i>inference models</i> which
      show the RDF statements entailed by the data being reasoned over.
      The subsystem is designed to be extensible so that it should be possible to
      plug a range of external reasoners into Jena, though worked examples of doing
      so are left to a future release.
       See the <a href="doc/inference/index.html">reasoner documentation</a> 
      for more details. 
      <br>Of these components, the underlying rule engine and the RDFS configuration should
      be reasonably stable. The OWL configuration is usable but  still under development and
      will undergo further tuning.</dd>
  <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
    <dt><b>Ontology Subsystem</b></dt>
    <dd>The Jena2 ontology API is intended to support programmers who are working
    	with ontology data based on RDF. Specifically, this means support for 
    	OWL, DAML+OIL and RDFS.  A set of Java abstractions extend the generic
    	RDF Resource and Property classes to model more directly the class and
    	property expressions found in ontologies using the above languages, and
    	the relationships between these classes and properties. The ontology API
    	works closely with the reasoning subsystem derive additional information
    	that can be inferred from a particular ontology source. Given that ontologists
    	typically modularise ontologies into individual, re-usable components, 
    	and pulish these on the web, the Jena2 ontology subsystem also includes a
    	document manager that assists with process of managing imported ontology documents.
 	See the <a href="doc/ontology/index.html">ontology documentation</a> 
      for more details.</dd>
    <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
  <dt><b>RDQL query language</b></dt>
	<dd>RDQL is a query language for RDF data. The implementation 
        in Jena is coupled to relational database storage so that optimized 
        query is performed over data held in a Jena relational persistene 
        store. </dd>
   <dd>See <a href="doc/tutorial/RDQL/index.html">RDQL Tutorial</a>.&nbsp; 
   Also see <a href="doc/RDQL/RDQL_Usage.html">RDQL_Usage.html</a>, 
   <a href="doc/RDQL/RDQL_Examples.html">RDQL_Examples.html</a> and
   <a href="doc/RDQL/rdql_grammar.html">rdql_grammar.html</a> for condensed
      documentation.</dd>

<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>Documentation is to be found in the <a href="doc/index.html">doc/ directory</a> 
of the Jena download.</p>
<p>The latest documentation is available at
<a href="http://jena.sourceforge.net/">http://jena.sourceforge.net/</a>.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<ul>
  <li>unzip the distribution file into a convenient directory, JENAROOT.</li>
  <li>set the Java classpath to include all the JAR files in the JENAROOT/lib/ 
  directory<pre>  JENAROOT/lib/jena.jar
  JENAROOT/lib/xercesImpl.jar
  JENAROOT/lib/xmlParserAPIs.jar
  JENAROOT/lib/icu4j.jar
  JENAROOT/lib/concurrent.jar
  JENAROOT/lib/jakarta-oro-2.0.5.jar
  JENAROOT/lib/antlr.jar
  JENAROOT/lib/junit.jar
  JENAROOT/lib/log4j-1.2.7.jar
  JENAROOT/lib/rdf-api-2001-01-19.jar
</pre>
			</li>
	
	<li>Test the distribution by running the regression tests, either:
			
	<pre>	ant test          // if you have ant configured to run junit
	test.bat          // on windows
	. test.sh         // on unix
	</pre>
	The  tests should all pass. If you are
	behind a firewall, you may have to configure a proxy for some
	of the tests - see below for the appropriate properties.
	</li>

</ul>


<h2>Applications</h2>

<p>The Jena distribution includes some convenience applications.</p>

<p><code>jena.rdfcopy </code>will read an RDF file in either RDF/XML, N3 or
n-triple format and write it to standard out in either RDF/XML, N3 or n-triple
format. It can be used to translate between different RDF serialization
formats.</p>

<p><code>jena.rdfcompare</code> will read two RDF files, in either RDF/XML, N3
or n-triple format and test whether they are equal.</p>

<p><code>jena.rdfquery </code>will execute an RDQL query on an RDF data file,
in either RDF/XML or n-triple format and print the table of results in text or
HTML. It can also be used to query a Jena model held in a BerkeleyDB
persistent store.</p>

<p><code>jena.rdfparse</code> is command line interface to the ARP RDF/XML
parser.</p>

<p><code>jena.n3</code> is a command line interfacec to Jena's N3 parser.</p>

<p><code>jena.schemagen</code> takes and RDF Schema or OWL ontologies and generates 
Java
source code for a constant class containing constants for all the classes and
properties defined in that schema.</p>

<p>These programs can be set use use a proxy to traverse a firewall by setting
system properties. To use a socks proxy include the following in the command
line:</p>

<pre>   -DsocksProxyHost=&lt;your-proxy-domain-name-or-ip-address&gt;</pre>

<p>To use an http proxy include the following on the command line:</p>

<pre>   -DproxySet=true -DproxyHost=&lt;your-proxy&gt; -DproxyPort=&lt;your-proxy-port-number&gt;</pre>
