<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Jena is a java API for manipulating RDF graphs. Its features include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>statement centric methods for manipulating an RDF model as a set of RDF
    triples</li>
  <li>resource centric methods for manipulating an RDF model as a set of
    resources with properties</li>
  <li>cascading method calls for more convenient programming</li>
  <li>built in support for RDF containers - bag, alt and seq</li>
  <li>enhanced resources - the application can extend the behaviour of
    resources</li>
  <li>integrated parsers and writers for RDF/XML (ARP), N3 and N-TRIPLES</li>
</ul>

<p>This jena toolkit includes a number of components:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>RDF Model API</li>
			<li>ARP parser compliant with latest working group recommendations</li>
			<li>integrated query language (RDQL)</li>
			<li>Support for datatype literals</li>
			<li>An ontology API for OWL, DAML+OIL and RDFS</li>
			<li>Support for inference, including a built in RDFS reasoner</li>
		</ul>

<p>While the intention is maintain the present API through the migration from
Jena 1 to Jena 2, we are taking the opportunity to make some minor changes
that folks have requested.  These are described in the document <a
href="doc/migrate1-2.html">Migrating from Jena 1 to Jena2</a>. You may notice
the javadoc is a lot smaller. This is largely because we are trying to not
include classes which are internal to the operation of Jena. </p>

<p> A key feature of the new architecture is making a clear distinction
between the Application Programming Interface (API), the System Programming
Interface (SPI) and the implementation.  The API is intended for use in
building applications that use Jena; this is where Model, Resource, etc live.
The SPI is entended for use in extending Jena, <i>eg</i> integrating new
persistent stores and reasoners: this is where the new Graph interface lives.
This release contains preliminary versions of SPI interfaces for integrating
new reasoners, and for "fast path" query which will allow us to pass complex
queries on to database engines.

<p>Earlier and more recent versions may be available from the Jena SourceForge web site -
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jena">http://sourceforge.net/projects/jena</a>.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<ul>
  <li>unzip the distribution file into a convenient directory, JENAROOT.</li>
  <li>set the class path to include:
			<pre>  JENAROOT/lib/jena.jar
  JENAROOT/lib/xercesImpl.jar
  JENAROOT/lib/xmlParserAPIs.jar
  JENAROOT/lib/icu4j.jar
  JENAROOT/lib/concurrent.jar
  JENAROOT/lib/jakarta-oro-2.0.5.jar
  // Not yet in Jena2 : JENAROOT/lib/db3-3-11.jar           // if using Berkeley DB interface
  JENAROOT/lib/antlr.debug.jar
  JENAROOT/lib/junit.jar
  JENAROOT/lib/rdf-api-2001-01-19.jar
</pre>
			</li>
	
	<li>Test the distribution by running the regression tests, either:
			
	<pre>	ant test          // if you have ant configured to run junit
	test.bat          // on windows
	. test.sh         // on unix
	</pre>
	The  tests should all pass. If you are
	behind a firewall, you may have to configure a proxy for some
	of the tests - see below for the appropriate properties.
	</li>

</ul>


<h2>Applications</h2>

<p>The Jena distribution includes some convenience applications.</p>

<p><code>jena.rdfcopy </code>will read an RDF file in either RDF/XML, N3 or
n-triple format and write it to standard out in either RDF/XML, N3 or n-triple
format. It can be used to translate between different RDF serialization
formats.</p>

<p><code>jena.rdfcompare</code> will read two RDF files, in either RDF/XML, N3
or n-triple format and test whether they are equal.</p>

<p><code>jena.rdfquery </code>will execute an RDQL query on an RDF data file,
in either RDF/XML or n-triple format and print the table of results in text or
HTML. It can also be used to query a Jena model held in a BerkeleyDB
persistent store.</p>

<p><code>jena.rdfparse</code> is command line interface to the ARP RDF/XML
parser.</p>

<p><code>jena.n3</code> is a command line interfacec to Jena's N3 parser.</p>

<p><code>jena.schemagen</code> takes and RDF Schema or OWL ontologies and generates 
Java
source code for a constant class containing constants for all the classes and
properties defined in that schema.</p>

<p>These programs can be set use use a proxy to traverse a firewall by setting
system properties. To use a socks proxy include the following in the command
line:</p>

<pre>   -DsocksProxyHost=&lt;your-proxy-domain-name-or-ip-address&gt;</pre>

<p>To use an http proxy include the following on the command line:</p>

<pre>   -DproxySet=true -DproxyHost=&lt;your-proxy&gt; -DproxyPort=&lt;your-proxy-port-number&gt;</pre>

<h2>Getting started with jena</h2>

<p>For the core java RDF API the key package to look at is
com.hp.hpl.rdf..model. This package defines all of the key interfaces which
the different implementations (jena.mem, jena.bdb, jena.common) conform
to.</p>

<p>The jena subsystems</p>

<dl>
  <dt><b>ARP parser</b></dt>
    <dd>ARP is a new RDF parser designed to be compliant with the latest working group recommendations. ARP is the default parser for jena. It can also be run standalone.  For more information on ARP see the documentation in <a
      href="doc/ARP/index.html">doc/ARP</a>.</dd>
  <dt><b>RDQL query language</b></dt>
			<dd>RDQL is a query engine for Jena. It provides the SquishQL language (see the grammar file for exact details).  See <a href="doc/RDQL/README-RDQL.txt">README_RDQL</a>, <a
      href="doc/RDQL/RDQL_Usage.html">RDQL_Usage.html</a>, <a
      href="doc/RDQL/RDQL_Examples.html">RDQL_Examples.html</a> and <a
      href="doc/RDQL/rdql_grammar.html">rdql_grammar.html</a>, for condensed
      documentation.</dd>
		</dl>
		
  <dl> 
    <dt><b>Reasoning Subsystem</b></dt>
    <dd>The Jena2 reasoner subsystem is designed to allow a range of inference 
      engines to be plugged into Jena. Such reasoners are primarily used to derive 
      additional RDF assertions which are entailed from some base RDF together 
      with any optional ontology information and the axioms and rule. See the 
      <a href="doc/user-manual/inference/index.html">reasoner documentation</a> 
      for more details. </dd>
  </dl>
  <dl> 
    <dt><b>Ontology Subsystem</b></dt>
    <dd>The Jena2 ontology API is intended to support programmers who are working
    	with ontology data based on RDF. Specifically, this means support for 
    	OWL, DAML+OIL and RDFS.  A set of Java abstractions extend the generic
    	RDF Resource and Property classes to model more directly the class and
    	property expressions found in ontologies using the above languages, and
    	the relationships between these classes and properties. The ontology API
    	works closely with the reasoning subsystem derive additional information
    	that can be inferred from a particular ontology source. Given that ontologists
    	typically modularise ontologies into individual, re-usable components, 
    	and pulish these on the web, the Jena2 ontology subsystem also includes a
    	document manager that assists with process of managing imported ontology documents.
 	See the 
      <a href="doc/user-manual/ontology/index.html">reasoner documentation</a> 
      for more details. </dd>
