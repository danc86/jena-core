<h2>Answers</h2>
<h3>General</h3>
<p id="general-0"><strong>Q: Why do I get a ClassNotFoundException when I run Jena?</strong><br>
  A: This means that one or more of the libraries that Jena depends on is not
  on your classpath. Typically, all of the librarys (.jar files) in $JENA/lib,
  where $JENA refers to the directory in which you installed Jena, should be on
  your classpath. Consult the documentation for your JDK for details on setting
  the classpath for your system. There are also a number of on-line tutorials for setting 
  the Java classpath. Consult Google or see 
  	<a href="http://www.dynamic-apps.com/tutorials/classpath.jsp">here</a>.</p>

<h3>RDF model API</h3>
    <p id="api-0"><strong>Q. Why does the localname part of my URI look wrong?</strong><br />
      A: In Jena it is possible to retrieve the localname part of a Resource or Property
      URI. Sometimes developers create Resources with a full URI reference but
      find that the result of a getLocalName call is not quite what they expected.
      This is usually because the URI is ill-formed or cannot be correctly split
      in the way you expected. The only reason for separating namespace and local
      name is to support the XML serialization in which qnames are used for properties
      and classes. Thus the main requirement of the split is that the localname
      component must be a legal XML NCName. This means it must start with a letter
      or _ character and can only contain limited punctuation. In particular,
      they can't contain spaces, but then spaces are not legal in URI references
      anyway. In general, it is best to not use the localname split to encode
      any information, you should only be concerned with it if you are coding
      a parser or writer.</p>

    <p id="api-1"><strong>Q. How do I change the URI or localName of a Resource?</strong><br />
      <strong>A:</strong> In Jena, the URI of a resource is invariant.  
      So there is no <code>setLocalName()</code>, or <code>setURI()</code> method, 
      and there will never be one.<br />
      The only way to "rename" a resource is to remove all of the statements that 
      mention resource <em>R</em>, add add new statements with <em>R</em> replaced by <em>R'</em>.  
      A utility for doing this is provided: <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;<code>com.hp.hpl.jena.util.ResourceUtils.renameResource()</code><br />
      If you are working with inference or ontology models, you need to be 
      careful to do this on the base model, not the entailment model.
    </p>

<h3>Reasoner and inference models</h3>
  <p id="reasoner-0"><strong>Q. I want to develop my own rules, how do I get started?</strong><br />
    A: The GenericRuleReasoner is the place to start. You can create instances of this reasoner by
    supplying either an explict set of Rule objects or a configuration description (as a Jena Model)
    that points to a local rule file. See the inference documentation for more details: <br />
    <a href="inference/index.html#rules">inference/index.html#rules</a>
  </p>

  <p id="reasoner-1"><strong>Q. Why are there two different arrows ( -&gt; and &lt;- ) in the rule syntax?</strong><br />
    A: As explained in the documentation there are two rule systems available - a
    forward chainer and a backward chainer. You can chose to use either or
    use the two together in a hybrid mode. <br />

    So if we use Ti as short hand for triple patterns like (?x rdf:type ?C),
    and if we ignore functors and procedural call out for now, then the syntax:<br />
    <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    T1, T2, ... TN -> T0 .    </code> <br />
    means that if the triple patterns T1 to TN match in the data set then
    then the triple T0 can be deduced as a consequence. Similarly <br />
    <code> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   T0 <- T1, T2, ... TN .    </code> <br />
    means the same thing - the consequence is always on the "pointy" end of
    the arrow. <br />

    Now if you are just using pure forward or backward rules then you could
    chose to use either syntax interchangeably. This allows you to write a
    rule set and use it in either mode. Though in practice "-&gt;" is the more
    conventional direction in forward systems and "&lt;-" is the more
    conventional one in backward systems. <br />

    The hybrid configuration allows you to create new backward rules as a
    result of forward rules firing so that the syntax: <br />
    <code> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    T1, T2 -> [T0 <- T3, T4] .     </code> <br />
    Is saying that if both T1 and T2 match in the dataset then add the
    backward rule "[T0 &lt;- T3, T4]" after instantiating any bound variables.
  </p>
  
  <p id="reasoner-2"><strong>Q. The domain and range inferences look wrong, is that a bug?</strong><br />
      A: The way rdfs range and domain declarations work is completely alien to 
      anyone who thinks of RDFS and OWL as being a bit like a type system for 
      a programming language, especially an object oriented language. Whilst there 
      may be bugs in the inference rule sets the most common explanation for supprising 
      results, when listing inferred domains and ranges, is this mismatch in expectations. 
    <p> Suppose we have three classes <code>eg:Man</code> is an <code>rdfs:subClassOf</code> 
      <code>eg:Person</code> is an <code>rdfs:subClassOf</code> <code>eg:Animal</code>. 
      Suppose we a property <code>eg:personalName</code> which is declared to 
      have <code>rdfs:domain</code> <code>eg:Person</code>. Now the question is 
      what other values can be inferred for the <code>rdfs:domain</code> of <code>eg:personalName</code>?</p>
    <p> In pure RDFS no additional conclusions can be made. The definition of 
      domain and range is <i>intensional</i> not <i>extensional</i>. It only works 
      forward. Declaring <code>&lt;eg:personalName rdfs:domain eg:Person&gt;</code> 
      means that anything to which <code>eg:personalName</code> is applied can 
      be concluded to be of type <code>eg:Person</code>. It does not work backward 
      - if you somehow knew that all things to which <code>eg:personalName</code> 
      applied were also <code>Foo</code>'s you cannot conclude that <code>&lt;eg:personalName 
      rdfs:domain Foo&gt;.</code></p>
    <p>However, RDFS permits systems to strengthen the meaning of domain and range 
      to be extensional, so that valid domain and range deductions can be made. 
      OWL makes use of this option. So in OWL, then in our example we can also 
      deduce that <code>&lt;eg:personalName rdfs:domain eg:Animal&gt;</code>. 
      If you are used to object oriented programming this may look wrong. It is 
      tempting, but incorrect, to think of rdfs:domain as meaning <i>this is the 
      class of objects to which this property can be applied. </i>With that mind-set 
      you might expect to find that <code>&lt;eg:personalName rdfs:domain eg:Man&gt;</code>, 
      after all every <code>eg:Man</code> is an <code>eg:Person</code> so it is 
      always &quot;legal&quot; to apply <code>eg:personalName</code> to an <code>eg:Man</code>. 
      That is true, it is legal, any <code>eg:Man</code> is allowed to have a 
      a <code>eg:personalName</code> but <code>rdfs:domain</code> does not describe 
      what is legal. The statement <code>&lt;P rdfs:domain C&gt;</code> just means 
      <i>all things to which P is applied can be inferred to have class C</i>. 
      You can see that if we tried to infer <code>&lt;eg:personalName rdfs:domain 
      eg:Man&gt;</code> then we would start concluding that anything with a name 
      was a man which is not right - every Man can have a name but non-Man Persons 
      are also allowed to have names in this example.</p>
     
  <p id="reasoner-3"><strong>Q: Why do I get a warning: <i>Creating OWL rule reasoner working over another OWL rule reasoner</i></strong><br />
      A: If you create an infernce graph explicitly from an OWL reasoner or implicitly
      (by using OntModelSpec.OWL_*_RULE) then it is best if the argument models
      (data and schema) are plain models. It is easy to accidently misuse the API and
      create an inference model working over the results of another inference model.
	  This is a redunancy which significantly affects performance to no useful effect.
	  To help detect this situation we have added a warning message. The best way
	  to stop the message is to change your model construction code so that only the
	  final InfModel/OntModel is specified to use OWL inference. If this is not
	  appropriate for some reason you can disable the check and warning messages 
	  using the global flag <code>com.hp.hpl.jena.shared.impl.JenaParameters.enableOWLRuleOverOWLRuleWarnings.</code></p>
      
      
    <h3>Ontology API</h3>
<p id="ontology-0"><strong>Q: Why doesn't <code>listClasses()</code> (or <code>listProperties()</code>/<code>listIndividuals()</code>,
  etc) work?</strong><br />
  <strong>A:</strong> It does work. Extensive unit tests are used to check the correctness of Jena,
  and are included in the downloaded source code for your reference. If <code>listClasses()</code>,
  or a similar method, is not producing the answers you expect, or no answers
  at all, you should first check that your model is correctly defined. Print a
  copy of your model as a debug step, to see if the URI's match up (e.g, if you
  are expecting resource x to be an individual of class Y, check that the rdf:type
  of x is the same as the URI of the class declaration for Y). A common problem
  is that relative URI's change depending where you read the model from. Try adding
  an <code>xml:base</code> declaration to the document to ensure that URI's are
  correctly specified.</p>

<p id="ontology-1"><strong>Q: Why doesn't the ontlogy API handle <code>sub-class</code>
	(or <code>sub-property</code>, <code>domain</code>, <code>range</code>, etc)
  	relationships in a DAML model?</strong><br />
  	<strong>A:</strong> These relationships are handled correctly, but the results you see are dependent on the
  	model configuration.  The DAML specification includes a number of aliases for RDFS constructs to
  	copy them into the DAML+OIL namespace. This means that, for a DAML processor, <code>daml:subClassOf</code>
  	and <code>rdfs:subClassOf</code> are equivalent.  This is declared by means of a
  	<code>daml:samePropertyAs</code> in the daml+oil.daml specification document.  Without a reasoner
  	attached to the model, the ontology API will not recognise the equivalence with <code>rdfs:</code> properties.
  	Thus, if you are not seeing the expected results when processing a DAML ontology,
  	it is likely that your ontology file contains, for example, <br />
  	<code>&lt;daml:Class rdf:ID="A"&gt; &lt;rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="B" /&gt; ...</code> <br />
  	To fix this, either ensure that the ontology consistently uses <code>daml:</code> relationships,
  	or declare the ontology model with the DAML micro rule-reasoner: <br />
  	<code>OntModel m = ModelFactory.createOntologyModel( OntModelSpec.DAML_MEM_RULE_INF, null );</code>
	</p>

<p id="ontology-2">
  <strong>Q: Why does <code>.as(&nbsp;OntProperty.class&nbsp;)</code> fail with
  <code>ConversionException</code> on SymmetricProperty (or other property types)?</strong><br />
  <strong>A:</strong> This is a slightly tricky issue.  Internally, <code>.as()</code> calls the <em>supports</em> check,
  which tests whether the node that is being converted is a common flavour of property.
  Strictly, the only necessary test should be '<code>has rdf:type rdf:Property</code>',
  because that is entailed by all of the other property types.  However, that requires
  the user to use a model with a reasoner, and some don't want to (for good reasons, e.g. building an editor).
  The other position is to test for all the possible variants of property: object property,
  datatype property, annotation, ontology, transitive, funcitonal, inverse functional, etc etc.
  The problem with this is that it duplicates the work of the reasoner, and my expectation was that
  most people would be running with a reasoner.  Thus my code would be duplicating the functionality
  of the reasoner, which is bad design. The compromise solution was to make the supports check test
  for the common (top level) property types.  Users who aren't using the reasoner,
  can either test explicitly for the other property types they expect to encounter (e.g. SymmetricProperty),
  or can turn off the supports check by setting
  <a href="javadoc/com/hp/hpl/jena/ontology/OntModel.html#strictMode()">strict mode</a> to false on the model.

<h3>Database and persistence</h3>
<p id="db-0"><strong>Q: Why do I get an exception when trying to create a new persistent model?</strong><br>
  A: Assuming that your program uses correct methods to create the model (see
examples in the database <a href="DB/howto.html">howto</a>), it may be that
your database files are corrupted. Jena2 does <i>not</i> do a good job in
checking the validity of the database. It makes a cursory check that some
required tables exist but does not check that the tables contain valid data. If
you suspect your database has been corrupted, you may invoke
<code>cleanDB()</code> on a DBConnection object
prior to creating your model. This removes all Jena2 tables from a database.
Warning: this removes any other existing Jena2 models from the database so make sure
that this is what you want to do. </p>

  <p id="db-1"><strong>Q: Why do I run out of memory when trying to list statements in a persistent
  model?</strong><br>
  A: Jena2 uses the JDBC interface for accessing databases. The JDBC
  specification has no cursors. Consequently, when a query is processed by JDBC,
  the entire result set is returned from the database at once and the application program then iterates
  over the in-memory result set. If the result set is large, as is often the case
  when listing all statements of a large model, it may exceed the heap size of
  the Java virtual machine. If you suspect this is happening, you might try to
  increase the heap size of the Java virtual machine (<code>-vmargs
  -Xmx500M</code> for a 500 MB heap size). If this does not help, there is no
  other work-around and the program should be recoded.</p>
  
<p id="db-2"><strong>Q: Has Jena2 persistence been ported to other database engines and platforms
  besides those officially supported?</strong><br>
  A: The Jena team  supports Jena2 persistence on the databases and operating
systems listed in the <a href="DB/index.html">Database Interface Release
Notes</a>.
Other users have had success porting Jena2 to other databases and platforms.
Jena2 has been ported to IBM's DB2 database. Contact
<a href="mailto:zhabglj@us.ibm.com">Liang-Jie Zhang</a> for details. A port to
HSQLDB, a native-Java SQL database, has been done. Contact
<a href="mailto:danils@home.se">Jan Danils</a> for details. On the Mac OS X
platform, Jena2 has been successfully run using MySQL. Contact
<a href="mailto:jnachlin@nachlin.com">Jim Nachlin</a> for details. A Jena2 
driver for Microsoft SQL Server has been written and tested with MsSQL 2000. The 
source is available at <a href="http://www.ur.se/jena/Jena2MsSql.zip">
http://www.ur.se/jena/Jena2MsSql.zip</a>. Contact <a href="mailto:eba@ur.se">
Erik Barke</a> for more information.</p>

<p id="db-3"><strong>Q: Is there a limit on 
the number of models in a database?</strong><br>
  <strong>A:</strong> The limit depends on the Jena database (schema) configuration and the 
database engine (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, etc). Recall that a Jena model may 
either be stored separately in its own database tables (the default) or, 
alternatively, in tables that are shared with other models (see <i>
StoreWithModel</i> in the <a href="DB/options.html">options</a> for 
persistent models). Also, a Jena model is identified internally by a 32 bit 
integer. Consequently the maximum number of models is limited either by the 
maximum number of tables allowed in a database (which depends on the database 
engine) or by the maximum value of a 32 bit integer, i.e., 2G.</p>

<h3>XML serialisation (reading and writing)</h3>
<p id="xml-0"><strong>Q: Why are some of my statement objects serialised as XML elements, and some as XML attributes?</strong><br />
  <strong>A:</strong> This is a feature of the default RDF/XML writer settings in Jena 2.0.
  Semantically, writing the object of a statement as an XML element or XML attribute makes
  no difference to the RDF meaning. However, we have recognised that this is confusing, so
  from Jena-2.1-dev3 onwards, the default is to write out all statements objects as XML elements.<br />
  The process that is behind the output is the invocation of a rule in the RDF/XML writer, that 
  writes values that contain no spaces as attributes.  This rule can be turned on or off
  selectively by using an explicit <code>RDFWriter</code> object, rather than relying on the
  defaults that apply by calling <code>Model.write()</code>. The means of doing this are described
  in the <a href="IO/iohowto.html#output">I/O howto</a>. In particular, the rule <code>propertyAttr</code>
  must be enabled or disabled.

<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>

<p id="misc-0">
  <strong>Q: What versions of library jars does Jena require?</strong><br />
  <strong>A:</strong> Jena makes use of several third party java libraries. Copies of
  each of these is included in the $JENA/lib area of the distribution and we recommend
  including all of these jars in your classpath. In some circumstances applications 
  already make use of specific versions of these libraries (e.g. Xerces) and need to 
  check if the version they are using is compatible with those shipped by Jena. The current
  library versions used by Jena are:
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Xerces</strong> - 2.6.1 (not compatible with Xerces prior to 2.6.0)</li>
  <li><strong>log4j</strong> - 1.2.7</li>
  <li><strong>junit</strong> - ?</li>
  <li><strong>icu4j</strong> - ?</li>
  <li><strong>jakarta-oro</strong> - 2.0.5</li>
  <li><strong>antlr</strong> - 2.7.2</li>
  <li><strong>jakarta-commons-logging</strong> - 1.0.3</li>
  <li><strong>concurrent</strong> - 1.3.2</li>
