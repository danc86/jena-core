<h1>Extensions in ARQ</h1>
<p>There are several ways to extend ARQ:</p>

<ul>
<li>Value Functions - additional operations in FILTERS</li>
<li>Graph matching extensions - addition graph matching operations</li>
<li>DESCRIBE handlers</li>
<li>Support for finding blank nodes</li>
<li>New query engines for performance in special circumstances</li>
</ul>



<p>Functions are standard part of SPARQL. ARQ provides <a href="functions.html">
application-written functions</a> and also provides a <a href="functions.html">
function library</a>.</p>
<h2>Extensions</h2>
<p>ARQ also provides the ability to write custom extensions.&nbsp; 
This not part of SPARQL; the application will need to use the ARQ query language 
(a superset of SPARQL). Unlike a value function, an extension can set 
variables and generate multiple solutions. An extensions can also query the 
dataset.</p>
<pre class="box">EXT q:name(?a, ?b, ?c)</pre>
<p>Writing a an extension requires understanding of the ARQ query engine. See
<a href="architecture.html">ARQ Query Engine Design</a>. </p>
<p class="todo">@@ to be written. Extension is loaded like functions.&nbsp; 
Likely to change.</p>

<h2 id="describeHandlers" name="describeHandlers">DESCRIBE handlers</h2>
<p>The <code>DESCRIBE</code> result form in SPARQL does not define an exact form 
of RDF to return.&nbsp; Instead, it allows the server or query processor to 
return what it considers to be an appropriate description of the resources 
located. This description will be specific to the domain, data modelling or 
application.</p>
<p>ARQ comes with one built-in handler which calculates the blank node closure 
of resources found. While suitable for many situations, it is not general (for 
example, a <a href="http://www.foaf-project.org/">FOAF</a> file usually consists 
of all blank nodes). ARQ allows the application to replace or add handlers for 
producing <code>DESCRIBE</code> result forms.</p>
<p>Application-specific handlers can be added to the <code>
DescribeHandlerRegistry</code>. The handler will be called for each resource 
(not literals) identified by the <code>DESCRIBE</code> query.</p>
<h2>Blank Node Labels</h2>
<p>URIs from with scheme name &quot;_&quot; (which is illegal) are created as blank node 
labels for directly accessing a blank node in the queried graph or dataset.&nbsp; 
This are constant terms in the query - not unnamed variables. Do not confuse 
these with the standard qname notation for blank nodes in queries. This is not 
portable - use with case.</p>
<pre class="box">&lt;_:1234-5678-90&gt;    # A blank node in the data</pre>
<pre class="box">_:b0                # A blank node in the query - a variable</pre>
<h2>Specialized Query Engines</h2>
