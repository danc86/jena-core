<h1>RDQL Fastpath Query Processing</h1>

<h2>Fastpath Overview</h2>

<p>The goal of RDQL Fastpath query processing is to perform as much of the RDQL 
query processing as possible within the database engine. The standard RDQL query 
processing algorithm is to process each RDQL pattern as a separate <i>Find</i> 
operation. For database-backed models, this algorithm has high overhead for 
queries with variables. For example, consider the RDQL query:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font face="Courier New" size="2">&lt;Var1, ex:Name, &quot;Alice&quot;&gt; AND &lt;Var1, ex:City, 
&quot;Wonderland&quot;&gt;<br>
</font>The standard algorithm processes this query by generating one <i>Find</i> 
operation to get all Alices and then, for each Alice, generating an additional
<i>Find</i> operation to check if that Alice lives in Wonderland. However, a 
database engine could process both RDQL query patterns with a single join 
operation. The Fastpath algorithm generates SQL queries that match multiple 
patterns.</p>

<p>The Fastpath algorithm works by partitioning the patterns and constraints for 
a query into one or more groups, referred to as <i>stages</i>, where each stage consists of patterns that can 
be processed together. Stages that consist of more than one pattern are processed by a single, 
dynamically-generated SQL query. Stages that consist of just one pattern are processed by a <i>
Find</i> operation. This is considered more efficient than generating an SQL 
query (although this has not been measured). The Fastpath algorithm also determines a 
partial execution order for the stages in an attempt to minimize execution time.</p>

<p>The remainder of this document describes the Fastpath algorithm in more 
detail, including limitations, optimizations and future work. Jena2's support 
for different reification styles and use of a separate table for reification 
somewhat complicates the algorithm. These issues are discussed below.</p>

<h2>Fastpath Support for Standard Models</h2>

<p>In this section, we describe the Fastpath algorithm for the most general 
case, a model that uses the Standard reification style (i.e., standard RDF 
treatment of reification) and that may contain both asserted statements and 
reification triples. As mentioned above, a Jena2 query consists of a set of 
triple patterns and a set of constraints that apply to the variable bindings 
(e.g., Var5 != 1000). The Fastpath algorithm is summarized in the pseudo-code 
below.</p>

  <dl>
    <font SIZE="2">
    <dd><font face="Courier New">patternsToDo = all patterns in query</font></dd>
    <dd><font face="Courier New">// patternsToDo has the RDQL query patterns 
    that are not yet staged.</font></dd>
    <dd><font face="Courier New">while ( patternsToDo is not empty ) {</font></dd>
    <dd><font face="Courier New">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; staged = the lowest cost pattern 
    in remaining&nbsp; </font></dd>
    <dd><font face="Courier New">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // staged has the 
    query patterns to join in the next stage</font></dd>
    <dd><font face="Courier New">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; remove staged from 
    patternsToDo</font></dd>
    <dd><font face="Courier New">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; while ( patternsToDo is not 
    empty ) {</font></dd>
    <dt><font face="Courier New">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    joinPattern = a pattern in patternsToDo that joins with one in staged</font></dt>
    <dd><font face="Courier New">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    if ( joinPattern is null ) break</font></dd>
    <dt><font face="Courier New">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    add joinPattern to staged</font></dt>
    <dd><font face="Courier New">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    remove joinPattern from patternsToDo</font></dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    }</dt>
    <dd><font face="Courier New">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // now decide how to process 
    the stage - as a find op or an SQL query</font></dd>
    <dd><font face="Courier New">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if staged has one pattern</font></dd>
    <dd><font face="Courier New">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    generate find operation for this stage</font></dd>
    <dd><font face="Courier New">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; else</font></dd>
    <dd><font face="Courier New">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    generate SQL query for this stage</font></dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <font face="Courier New">}</font></dt>
    </font>
  </dl>

<p>The first step is to order the triple patterns by their estimated cost of 
evaluation. Currently, the cost estimate is a simple measure that ranks patterns 
with bound variables higher than patterns with unbound variables. Further, 
unbound variables over predicates are ranked lower than unbound variables over 
subjects or objects. The highest ranked pattern is then chosen as the first 
pattern in the next stage of patterns to process. </p>

<p>The next step is to all find patterns that can join with a staged pattern. 
The process iterates until no more patterns remain or no joins are found. In 
general, two patterns are considered joinable if they apply to the same database 
table, have a common variable and neither variable is bound to a predicate. 
However, in some cases joins of predicate variables are supported as described 
below. Joins across database tables are somewhat tricky and are deferred to a 
future release.</p>

<p>The final step is to generate code for the staged patterns. If there is a 
single pattern in the stage, it is considered more efficient to process the 
pattern as a find operation. For multiple patterns, a new SQL query is generated 
dynamically.</p>

<p>The final result of the Fastpath algorithm is a series of stages of query 
results where each stage is either a find operation or an SQL query. The stages 
are then evaluated in order, i.e., the output of one stage is used as input for 
variable bindings in the next stage. A final stage is used for processing the 
constraints by filtering the final results. Processing constraints within the 
database is deferred to a future release. Another limitation is that Fastpath 
processes patterns for different graph separately, i.e., it cannot generate SQL 
code for joins across graphs. This is also deferred to a future release.</p>

<h2>Fastpath Optimizations</h2>

<p>If it is known that a Jena model contains only asserted statements or if a 
user does not wish to query over reified statments, then  variables over 
predicates can 
be supported. This affects the algorithm that looks for joins (mentioned above) and 
should provide a performance benefit for queries that include predicate 
variables by reducing the number of stages. The RDB Query Handler supports a method,
<font face="Courier New" size="2">setQueryOnlyAsserted(true)</font>, for the user to 
declare that Fastpath should ignore reified statements in queries. Similarly, if 
a model contains only reified statements or the user only wishes to query 
reified statements, then <font face="Courier New" size="2">setQueryOnlyReified(true)</font>, 
may be called. However, currently, this latter call has no effect. A future release 
will support joins across predicate variable for reified statements.</p>

<p>If a model contains only fully reified statements or the user is only 
interested in querying fully reified statements (i.e., partially reified 
statements are to be ignored), then another optimization is possible that eliminates unnecessary joins for reified statements. For 
example, consider the following query over reified statements.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font face="Courier New" size="2">&lt;Var1, rdf:subject, &quot;Alice&quot;&gt; AND &lt;Var1, 
rdf:object, V2&gt;<br>
</font>This retrieves all reified statements about Alice. The normal Fastpath 
algorithm will generate a join for these two patterns. However, we note that 
fully reified statements are stored in a single database row. So, if the user is 
only interested in query results for fully reified statements, then the join can be replaced by a 
simple select. This optimization is enabled by calling
<font face="Courier New" size="2">queryFullReified(true)</font>.</p>

<p>To retrieve the current settings for any of these optimization settings, 
there are corresponding get methods, that return a boolean e.g.,<font face="Courier New" size="2"> 
getQueryOnlyAsserted().</font> Currently, the values of these options are not 
persisted in the database.</p>

<h2>Fastpath Support for Convenient and Minimal Reification Styles</h2>

<p>Convenient and Minimal reification styles hide reification triples from the
<i>Find</i> operation. Consequently, using these reification styles has the same 
effect as specifying <font face="Courier New" size="2">setQueryOnlyAsserted(true).</font></p>

<h2>Limitations</h2>

<h4>Known Bugs</h4>

<dl>
  <dd><b>Concurrent updates</b>: if the RDQL query is not run within a 
  transaction, anomalies may occur if the underlying persistent model is updated 
  by some other application between the the time an RDQL query is compiled and 
  subsequently executed. Generally, this should not be a problem but there are 
  situations where a query may return no results. In particular, if a query 
  references a long literal or URI, the database identifier for that object is 
  obtained at compilation time. If the literal does not exist at compilation 
  time but is subsequently added prior to running the query, then no results are 
  returned when, in fact, results should be returned. There may be other 
  examples of anomalies.</dd>
</dl>

<h4>Limitations</h4>

<dl>
  <dd><b>Querying across graphs.</b> Currently, Fastpath does not optimize 
  queries across graphs. A separate SQL statement is generated for each graph. 
  Some support for querying across graphs will be enabled in the future.</dd>
  <dd><b>Querying across tables.</b> Within a model, Fastpath only optimizes 
  patterns over the same table. Limited support for queryng across tables will 
  be enabled in the future.</dd>
  <dd><b>Predicate variables.</b> Fastpath only supports predicate variables in 
  the case that queryOnlyAsserted is true. In the future, it should also be 
  possible to enable predicate variables for some types of RDQL queries when queryOnlyReified 
  is true.</dd>
  <dd><b>Query Log.</b> There is currently no easy-to-use facility to log the 
  SQL statements generated by Fastpath. However, to print a&nbsp; trace of the 
  generated SQL on <font face="Courier New" size="2">System.out</font>, 
  uncomment line 60 of <font face="Courier New" size="2">
  jena.db.impl.DBStage.java</font>. In the future, we hope to add an API for 
  accessing information about the generated SQL, including the statement string.</dd>
