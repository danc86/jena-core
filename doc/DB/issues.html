<h1>Jena2 Database Interface - Open Issues</h1>



<h3>28 August, 2003</h3>



<h2>Open Issues</h2>



<dl>
  <dt>Persistent Model Interface</dt>
  <dd>There are three different mechanisms for creating persistent models. Users 
  are encouraged to use the factory methods for creating models (ModelMaker and 
  ModelSpec). However, this is a new mechanism that does not yet support all the 
  required functionality for persistent models. The ModelRDB class has methods 
  for constructing Jena2 persistent models. It also has Jena1-compatible methods 
  for creating persistent models. These ModelRDB methods are deprecated but may 
  still be needed by applications until the ModelMaker mechanism is fully 
  functional.</dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt>Namespace Prefix vs. URI Compression</dt>
  <dd>Jena2 provides persistence for namespace abbreviations. However, this 
  mechanism is separate from the URI compression scheme. This means that the 
  same URI prefix (namespace) may be stored in two different places or a URI may 
  be encoded in two different ways. It might be convenient if a common mechanism 
  were used so that URI compression might reuse existing namespace 
  abbreviations. It is unclear if there is a significant performance impact.</dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt>Fastpath Testing</dt>
  <dd>The Fastpath code for RDQL query processing is not thoroughly tested and 
  missing significant capabilities. If problems are found or suspected, the 
  Fastpath code can be disabled. See <a href="fastpath.html">Fastpath</a> for 
  details on doing this.</dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
</dl>



  <h2><a name="features"></a>Known Bugs</h2>



  <p>There are many unknown bugs. Unfortunately, we have not had time to do as 
  much testing as we would have liked. Please do not hesitate to contact us on 
  the jena-dev or jena-devel lists when you suspect a problem.</p>
