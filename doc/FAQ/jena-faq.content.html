<h2>Answers</h2>
<h3>General</h3>
<p id="general-0"><strong>Q: Why do I get a ClassNotFoundException when I run Jena?</strong><br>
  A: This means that one or more of the libraries that Jena depends on is not
  on your classpath. Typically, all of the librarys (.jar files) in $JENA/lib,
  where $JENA refers to the directory in which you installed Jena, should be on
  your classpath. Consult the documentation for your JDK for details on setting
  the classpath for your system.</p>
<h3>RDF model API</h3>
    <p id="api-0"><strong>Q. Why does the localname part of my URI look wrong?</strong><br>
      In Jena it is possible to retrieve the localname part of a Resource or Property 
      URI. Sometimes developers create Resources with a full URI reference but 
      find that the result of a getLocalName call is not quite what they expected. 
      This is usually because the URI is ill-formed or cannot be correctly split 
      in the way you expected. The only reason for separating namespace and local 
      name is to support the XML serialization in which qnames are used for properties 
      and classes. Thus the main requirement of the split is that the localname 
      component must be a legal XML NCName. This means it must start with a letter 
      or _ character and can only contain limited punctuation. In particular, 
      they can't contain spaces, but then spaces are not legal in URI references 
      anyway. In general, it is best to not use the localname split to encode 
      any information, you should only be concerned with it if you are coding 
      a parser or writer.</p>
    <h3>Reasoner and inference models</h3>
<p>no entries yet</p>
<h3>Ontology API</h3>
<p id="ontology-0"><strong>Q: Why doesn't <code>listClasses()</code> (or <code>listProperties()</code>/<code>listIndividuals()</code>,
  etc) work?</strong><br />
  A: It does work. Extensive unit tests are used to check the correctness of Jena,
  and are included in the downloaded source code for your reference. If <code>listClasses()</code>,
  or a similar method, is not producing the answers you expect, or no answers
  at all, you should first check that your model is correctly defined. Print a
  copy of your model as a debug step, to see if the URI's match up (e.g, if you
  are expecting resource x to be an individual of class Y, check that the rdf:type
  of x is the same as the URI of the class declaration for Y). A common problem
  is that relative URI's change depending where you read the model from. Try adding
  an <code>xml:base</code> declaration to the document to ensure that URI's are
  correctly specified.</p>
<p id="ontology-1"><strong>Q: Why doesn't the ontlogy API handle <code>sub-class</code> 
	(or <code>sub-property</code>, <code>domain</code>, <code>range</code>, etc) 
  	relationships in a DAML model?</strong><br />
  	A: These relationships are handled correctly, but the results you see are dependent on the
  	model configuration.  The DAML specification includes a number of aliases for RDFS constructs to
  	copy them into the DAML+OIL namespace. This means that, for a DAML processor, <code>daml:subClassOf</code>
  	and <code>rdfs:subClassOf</code> are equivalent.  This is declared by means of a 
  	<code>daml:samePropertyAs</code> in the daml+oil.daml specification document.  Without a reasoner
  	attached to the model, the ontology API will not recognise the equivalence with <code>rdfs:</code> properties.
  	Thus, if you are not seeing the expected results when processing a DAML ontology, 
  	it is likely that your ontology file contains, for example, <br />
  	<code>&lt;daml:Class rdf:ID="A"&gt; &lt;rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="B" /&gt; ...</code> <br />
  	To fix this, either ensure that the ontology consistently uses <code>daml:</code> relationships,
  	or declare the ontology model with the DAML micro rule-reasoner: <br />
  	<code>OntModel m = ModelFactory.createOntologyModel( OntModelSpec.DAML_MEM_RULE_INF, null );</code>
