      Known restrictions and limitations
    </h2>
    <p>
    The ontology API for Jena 2 is a work in progress.  This page lists the primary known issues
    and limitations for the current release (Jena 2, preview 1 aka J2P1). Please review these
    issues before reporting bugs.  Bug reports should be sent to the
    <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/jena-dev/">jena-dev</a> support list,
    hosted by YahooGroups
    </p>
    <h3>Open issues (J2P2)</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>Inference<br />This release includes only limited inferencing, approximately of the same power
    of the legacy DAML API.  However, this is achieved using the new inferencing plug-in machinery. To get
    sub-class and sub-property entailments from DAML documents, you must import the daml+owl base
    ontology so that the appropriate aliases for subClassOf and subPropertyOf can be determined.
    </li>
    <li>
    Persistence<br />This release does not include any persistent models, so it is not possible to
    use ontology models with persistent stores.
    </li>
    <li>
    Legacy DAML API<br />We plan to port the DAML API from Jena 1 to Jena 2, though it will be adapted
    to use the new ontology model behind the scenes. This will make it easier for Jena 1 users to
    migrate to Jena 2.  While the DAML API will be supported, users are recommended to gradually
    migrate to the new API, and to begin new projects using only the new API.  The port of the Jena 1
    DAML API is not part of this release.
    </li>
    <li>
    OWL conformance<br />We are planning to include a conformance checker that will ascertain which
    of the three OWL species (Lite, DL and Full) an ontology is using, and to assist users to remain
    at their chosen language level. This conformance support is not part of this release.
    </li>
    </ol>
