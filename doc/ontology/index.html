<H1 CLASS="western">The Jena2 Ontology API</H1>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">This document describes ontology
document handling in Jena2. Jena2 is not a full-fledged ontology
managment application, such as Protoge [Protoge] or KAON [Kaon] or
others. Rather, our goal is to provide suppor for developers building
ontology-based applications using Jena as a platform. Other tools,
such as those mentioned, are useful complements when building,
testing and maintaining ontologies.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Jena 1.X provided a basic API for
reading and manipulating DAML+OIL [daml+oil] ontology documents.
Though useful, this DAML API had a number of limitations, including:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">very limited support for <I>ontology
	reasoning;</I></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal">unable to
	process ontlogies stored in <I>persistent RDF stores, </I>such as
	the Jena 1 ModelRDB;</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal">tightly bound
	to the DAML+OIL ontology language;</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal">limited
	integration with the other capabilites of the Jena1 platform.</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal">The Jena2 ontology
support has been completely re-written to address these previous
shortcomings, and to provide a more flexible and complete foundation
for processing ontologies in user applications. Particuar innovations
in this release include:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal">a new internal
	architecture, based on Jena2's <I>RDF-level polymorpism, </I>that
	allows complete flexibility in viewing a given RDF resource though a
	variety of differnt presentation facets (such as an <I>ontology
	class)</I>.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal">support for
	pluggable reasoning services that allow reasoning over ontology
	sources, allowing applictions to exploit much more of the rich
	semantics provided by ontology languages;</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal">an <I>ontology
	document manager</I> that allows much more control over building the
	imports closure (the set of all imported ontologies) of a given
	ontology document, and includes caching and local redirection
	support;</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal">the ability to
	attach ontology models to persistent RDF stores;</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal">a single API
	for ontology processing, parameterised by the actual ontology
	language being processed.</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal">The last point is
notable in that, in the time between the release of Jena1 and Jena2,
the W3C's WebOnt working group [webont] has developed and released
the <I>Web Ontology Language (OWL) </I>[owl]. Note: at the time of
writing, OWL is in last-call status. We expect OWL to become the
dominant ontology language for the Semantic Web in time. However, for
the present, many extant ontologies and in-development projects are
using DAML+OIL. While these languages are similar, there is
non-trivial cost in converting from one to the other. We therefore
expect that DAML+OIL will remain an important ontology language for
some time to come. Rather than provide two separate API's, one for
DAML and one for OWL, Jena2 provides a single ontology package that
combines support for a variety of ontology languages via a <I>language
profile</I> (note: for obvious reasons, acceptable languages have to
be reasonable similar, as with DAML+OIL and OWL). By selecting a
different language profile when creating an ontology model, access to
ontology documents encoded in differnt languages is available without
changing user-level Java code. More on language profiles can be found
here [todo ref].</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal">Note that, to
assist users porting code from Jena1, the Jena1 DAML+OIL API has also
been adapted to Jena2. We recommend, however, that new applictions be
developed against the new ontology API.</P>
