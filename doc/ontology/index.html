      This document describes ontology document handling in Jena2. Jena2 is not a full-fledged ontology managment application, such as Protoge [Protoge] or KAON [Kaon] or others. Rather, our goal is to provide suppor for developers building ontology-based applications using Jena as a platform. Other tools, such as those mentioned, are useful complements when building, testing and maintaining ontologies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jena 1.X provided a basic API for reading and manipulating DAML+OIL [daml+oil] ontology documents. Though useful, this DAML API had a number of limitations, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        very limited support for <i>ontology reasoning;</i>
      </li>
      <li>
        unable to process ontlogies stored in <i>persistent RDF stores,</i> such as the Jena 1 ModelRDB;
      </li>
      <li>
        tightly bound to the DAML+OIL ontology language;
      </li>
      <li>
        limited integration with the other capabilites of the Jena1 platform.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The Jena2 ontology support has been completely re-written to address these previous shortcomings, and to provide a more flexible and complete foundation for processing ontologies in user applications. Particuar innovations in this release include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        a new internal architecture, based on Jena2's <i>RDF-level polymorpism,</i> that allows complete flexibility in viewing a given RDF resource though a variety of differnt presentation facets (such as an <i>ontology class)</i>.
      </li>
      <li>
        support for pluggable reasoning services that allow reasoning over ontology sources, allowing applictions to exploit much more of the rich semantics provided by ontology languages;
      </li>
      <li>
        an <i>ontology document manager</i> that allows much more control over building the imports closure (the set of all imported ontologies) of a given ontology document, and includes caching and local redirection support;
      </li>
      <li>
        the ability to attach ontology models to persistent RDF stores;
      </li>
      <li>
        a single API for ontology processing, parameterised by the actual ontology language being processed.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The last point is notable in that, in the time between the release of Jena1 and Jena2, the W3C's WebOnt working group [webont] has developed and released the <i>Web Ontology Language (OWL)</i> [owl]. Note: at the time of writing, OWL is in last-call status. We expect OWL to become the dominant ontology language for the Semantic Web in time. However, for the present, many extant ontologies and in-development projects are using DAML+OIL. While these languages are similar, there is non-trivial cost in converting from one to the other. We therefore expect that DAML+OIL will remain an important ontology language for some time to come. Rather than provide two separate API's, one for DAML and one for OWL, Jena2 provides a single ontology package that combines support for a variety of ontology languages via a <i>language profile</i> (note: for obvious reasons, acceptable languages have to be reasonable similar, as with DAML+OIL and OWL). By selecting a different language profile when creating an ontology model, access to ontology documents encoded in differnt languages is available without changing user-level Java code. More on language profiles can be found here [todo ref].
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that, to assist users porting code from Jena1, the Jena1 DAML+OIL API has also been adapted to Jena2. We recommend, however, that new applictions be developed against the new ontology API.
