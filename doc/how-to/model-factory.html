<h1>introduction</h1>

Jena has become a moderately complicated system, with several different kinds
of <code>Model</code> and ways of constructing them. This note describes the
Jena 2 <code>ModelFactory</code>, your one-stop shop for creating Jena models.
<code>ModelFactory</code> lives in <code>com.hp.hpl.jena.rdf.model</code>,
which you will import anyway to do anything with models.

<p>Most of <code>ModelFactory</code> methods have been around for a while now,
but Jena 2.0 contains the first versions of the <code>ModelSpec</code>
interface, which allows models to be created according to RDF descriptions
that can be programmatically constructed or read in from external resources
such as configuration files. This new interface will be subject to change as
users (and ourselves) experiment with it.

<p>This note is an introduction, not an exhaustive description. As usual
consult the Javadoc for details of the methods and classes to use.

<h1>simple model creation</h1>

The simplest way to create a model (if not the shortest) is to call
<code>ModelFactory.createDefaultModel()</code>. This [by default] delivers a
plain RDF model, stored in-memory, that does no inference and has no special
ontology.

<blockquote>
    Jena 1 users used to <code>new ModelMem()</code> for creating models
    should switch to using <code>createDefaultModel()</code>.
</blockquote>

<h1>ModelMakers</h1>

Plain models can be given names which allows them "saved" and looked up by
name later. This is handled by implementations of the interface
<code>ModelMaker</code>; each <code>ModelMaker</code> produces Models of the
same kind. The simplest kind of <code>ModelMaker</code> is a memory model
maker, which you get by calling
<code>ModelFactory.createMemModelMaker()</code>. The methods you'd want to use
to start with on a ModelMaker are:

<ul>

<li><code>createModel(String)</code>: create a model with the given name in
the ModelMaker. If a model with that name already exists, then that model iis
used instead.

<li><code>openModel(String)</code>: open an existing model with the given
name. If no such model exists, create a new empty one and give it that name.

[createModel(String) and openModel(String) behave in the same way, but each
has a two-argument form for which the behaviour is different. Use whichever
one best fits your intention.]

<li><code>createModel()</code>: create a fresh anonymous model.

<li><code>getModel()</code>: each <code>ModelMaker</code> has a <i>default
model</i>; this method returns that model.

</ul>

There are other methods, for removing models, additional control over create
<i>vs</i> open, closing the maker, and looking names up; for those consult the
<a href="../javadoc/com/hp/hpl/jena/rdf/model/ModelMaker.html">ModelMaker
javadoc</a>.

<h2>file-based models</h2>

The method <code>ModelFactory.createFileModelMaker(String)</code> returns a
<code>ModelMaker</code> which attaches models to filing-system files. The
<code>String</code> argument is the <i>fileBase</i>. When a file-ModelMaker
opens a file, it reads it from a file in the directory named by the fileBase;
when the model is closed (and <i>only</i> then, in the current
implementation), the contents of the model are written back to the file.

<p>Because the names of models in a modelMaker can be arbitrary character
strings, in particular URIs, they are translated slightly to avoid confusion
with significant characters of common filing systems. In the current
implementation,

<ul>
<li> colon : is converted to _C
<li> slash / is converted to _S
<li> underbar _ is converted to _U
</ul>
