<h1>introduction</h1>

Jena has become a moderately complicated system, with several different kinds
of <code>Model</code> and ways of constructing them. This note describes the
Jena 2 <code>ModelFactory</code>, your one-stop shop for creating Jena models.

<p>Most of <code>ModelFactory</code> methods have been around for a while now,
but Jena 2.0 contains the first versions of the <code>ModelSpec</code>
interface, which allows models to be created according to RDF descriptions
that can be programmatically constructed or read in from external resources
such as configuration files. This new interface will be subject to change as
users (and ourselves) experiment with it.

<p>This note is an introduction, not an exhaustive description. As usual
consult the Javadoc for details of the methods and classes to use.
