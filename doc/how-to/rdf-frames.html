<h1 id="title">Presenting RDF as frames</h1>
<p>The origins of RDF as a representation language include <em>frame languages</em>,
  in which an object, or frame, was the main unit of structuring data. Frames have
  <em>slots</em>, for example a <code>Person</code> frame might have an <code>age</code>
  slot, a <height>slot</height> etc.  RDF, however, has taken a step beyond frame
  languages by making <code>rdf:Property</code> a first class value, not an element
  of a frame or resource <em>per se</em>. In RDF, for example, an age property can
  be defined:
  <code>&lt;rdf:Property&nbsp;rdf:ID=&quot;age&quot;&gt;</code>, and then applied to
  any resource, including, but not limited to a <code>Person</code> resource.
</p>
<p>While this introduces an extra element of modelling flexibility in RDF, it is
  often the case that users want to treat some components in their models in
  a more structured way, similar to the original idea of frames. It is often
  assumed that <code>rdfs:domain</code> restricts a property to be used only
  on resources that are in the domain class. For example, a frequently asked
  question on the Jena support list is why the following is not an error:</p>
<pre>
  &lt;rdfs:Class rdf:ID=&quot;Person&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;rdfs:Class rdf:ID=&quot;Truck&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;rdf:Property rdf:ID=&quot;age&quot;&gt;
    &lt;rdfs:domain rdf:resource=&quot;Person&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/rdf:Property&gt;

  &lt;Truck rdf:ID=&quot;truck1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;age&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/Truck&gt;
</pre>
<p>Whereas many object-oriented or frame-oriented representations would regard it
  as an error that the <code>age</code> property was not being applied to a 
  <code>Person</code>, RDF-based applications are simply entitled to infer
  that <code>truck1</code> is a (that is, has <code>rdf:type</code>)
  <code>Truck</code> as well as a <code>Person</code>.
  This is unlikely to be the case in any real-world domain, but it is a valid RDF
  inference.</p>
<p>A consequence of RDF's design is that it is not really possible to answer
  the commonly asked question &quot;Which properties can be applied to 
  resources of class <em>C</em>?&quot;. Strictly speaking, the RDF answer is
  &quot;Any property&quot;. However, many developers have a legitimate requirement
  to present a composite view of classes and their associated properties, forming more
  a more succinct structuring of an ontology or schema. The purpose of this note
  is to explain the mechanisms built-in to Jena to support a frame-like view of
  resources, while remaining correct with respect to RDF (and OWL) semantics.
  </p>
  <h2 id="principles">Basic principles: the properties of a class</h2>
<p>Since any RDF property can be applied to any RDF resource, we require a 
  definition of the properties of a given class that respects RDF semantics.
  Consider the following RDF fragment:</p>
  
<pre>
  &lt;rdfs:Class rdf:ID=&quot;Person&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;rdf:Property rdf:ID=&quot;age&quot; /&gt;

  &lt;Person rdf:ID=&quot;jane_doe&quot;&gt;
    &lt;age&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/Person&gt;
</pre>

<p>Now consider that we add to this fragment that:</p>
<pre>
  &lt;rdf:Property rdf:about=&quot;age&quot;&gt;
    &lt;rdfs:domain rdf:resource=&quot;Person&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/rdf:Property&gt;
</pre>

<p>This additional information about the domain of the <code>age</code>
  property does not add any new entailments to the model. Why? Because
  we already know that <code>jane_doe</code> is a Person.  So we can consider
  <code>age</code> to be one of the properties of <code>Person</code> type
  resources, because if we use the property as a predicate of that resource,
  it doesn't add any new <code>rdf:type</code> information about the resource.
  Conversely, if we know that some resource has an <code>age</code>, we don't
  learn any new information by declaring that it has <code>rdf:type Person</code>.
  In summary, for the purposes of this HOWTO
  we define the <em>properties of a class</em> as just those 
  properties that don't entail any new type information when applied to 
  resources that are already known to be of that class.
  </p>  
  
<!--p>An alternative characterisation of the properties of a class, as defined in
  this HOWTO, is that they comprise the properties that characterise all
  members of the class. </p-->
<h2 id="">Class expressions and property hierarchies</h2>
<p>Given these basic principles, now consider the following RDF fragment:</p>

<pre>
  &lt;rdfs:Class rdf:ID=&quot;LivingThing&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;rdfs:Class rdf:ID=&quot;Animal&quot;&gt;
    &lt;rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource=&quot;#LivingThing&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/rdfs:Class&gt;
  
  &lt;rdfs:Class rdf:ID=&quot;Mammal&quot;&gt;
    &lt;rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource=&quot;#Animal&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/rdfs:Class&gt;
  
  &lt;rdf:Property rdf:ID=&quot;bodyHair&quot;&gt;
    &lt;rdfs:domain rdf:resource=&quot;Mammal&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/rdf:Property&gt;
</pre>

<p>Is <code>bodyHair</code> one of the properties of <code>Animal</code>? Yes, because
  any resource of <code>rdf:type Animal</code> can have a <code>fur</code> property
  (with value either true or false) without adding type information. Similarly, 
  any resource that is a <code>Mammal</code> also has <code>rdf:type Animal</code>
  (by the sub-class relation), so <code>fur</code> is a property of <code>Mammal</code>.
  However, <code>fur</code> is <em>not</em> a property of <code>LivingThing</code>,
  since we don't automatically know that a living thing is an animal - it may 
  be a plant. Stating that a given <code>LivingThing</code> has a <code>fur</code>
  property, even if the value is false, would entail the additional 
  <code>rdf:type</code> statement that the <code>LivingThing</code> is also
  an <code>Animal</code>.</p>
  
<p>For more complex class expressions in the domain, we look to see what simple
  domain constraints are entailed. For example, a domain constraint 
  <code>A&nbsp;&cap;&nbsp;B</code> for property <code>p</code>
  entails that both <code>p&nbsp;rdfs:domain&nbsp;A</code> and <code>p&nbsp;rdfs:domain&nbsp;B</code>
  are true. So, the properties of <code>A</code> and of <code>B</code> 
  will include <code>p</code>. However, if the domain of <code>p</code> is 
  <code>A&nbsp;&cup;&nbsp;B</code>, then neither <code>A</code> nor <code>B</code>
  will have <code>p</code> as a property, since that expression does
  not entail a simple domain relationship between either class and <code>p</code>.</p>
  
<p>Similarly, since sub-properties inherit the domain constraints of their parent
  property, the properties of a class will include the closure over the sub-property
  hierarchy. Extending the previous example, the properties of <code>Animal</code>
  and <code>Mammal</code> include both <code>bodyHair</code> and <code>longHair</code>:</p>
<pre>
  &lt;rdf:Property rdf:ID=&quot;bodyHair&quot;&gt;
    &lt;rdfs:domain rdf:resource=&quot;Mammal&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/rdf:Property&gt;
  
  &lt;rdf:Property rdf:ID=&quot;longHair&quot;&gt;
    &lt;rdfs:subPropertyOf rdf:resource=&quot;#bodyHair&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/rdf:Property&gt;
</pre>

<p>In general, there may be many different ways of deducing simple domain constraints
  from the axioms asserted in the ontology. Whether or not all of these possible
  deductions are present in any given RDF model depends on the power and completeness
  of the reasoner bound to that model.</p>
  
<h2>Properties of a class and restriction properties</h2>
<p>A commonly used idiom in some OWL ontologies is to use <em>Restrictions</em>
  to create an association between a class and the properties of instances
  of that class. For example, the following fragment shows that all instances
  of <code>Person</code> should have a <code>familyName</code> property:</p>
  
<pre>
  &lt;owl:Class rdf:ID=&quot;Person&quot;&gt;
    &lt;rdfs:subClassOf&gt;
      &lt;owl:Restriction&gt;
        &lt;owl:onProperty rdf:resource=&quot;#familyName&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;owl:minCardinality rdf:datatype=&quot;&amp;xsd;int&quot;&gt;1&lt;/owl:minCardinality&gt;
      &lt;/owl:Restriction&gt;
    &lt;/rdfs:subClassOf&gt;
  &lt;/owl:Class&gt;
</pre>

<p>This approach shows the intent of the ontology designer that <code>Person</code>
  instances have <code>familyName</code> properties, we do not regard it as one of
  the <em>properties of</em> <code>Person</code>, using the definition above. No type
  information is imparted about individuals that have a <code>familyName</code>.
  The Jena utility methods for listing the properties of a class (see below) will
  therefore not return properties associated with a class via a restriction
  <code>onProperty</code>. <strong>Note that this is a change from versions of
    Jena prior to release 2.2</strong>. From Jena 2.2 onwards, Jena provides a 
  separate mechanism for listing the properties associated with a class by way
  of the restrictions that are the super-classes of the class.
  </p>
  
<h2>The Java API</h2>
<p>Support for frame-like views of classes and properties is provided through
  the <a href="../ontology/index.html">ontology api</a>. The following methods
  are used to access the properties of a class, and the converse for
  properties:</p>
<pre>
  OntClass.<a href="../javadoc/com/hp/hpl/jena/ontology/OntClass.html#listDeclaredProperties()">listDeclaredProperties</a>();
  OntClass.<a href="../javadoc/com/hp/hpl/jena/ontology/OntClass.html#listDeclaredProperties(boolean)">listDeclaredProperties</a>( boolean all );
  OntProperty.<a href="../javadoc/com/hp/hpl/jena/ontology/OntProperty.html#listDeclaringClasses()">listDeclaringClasses</a>();
  OntProperty.<a href="../javadoc/com/hp/hpl/jena/ontology/OntClass.html#listDeclaringClasses(boolean)">listDeclaringClasses</a>( boolean all );
</pre>
<p>In addtion, the properties associated with a class by way of a restriction are available 
  through the following API call:</p>
  
<pre>
  OntClass.<a href="../javadoc/com/hp/hpl/jena/ontology/OntClass.html#listRestrictionProperties()">listRestrictionProperties</a>();
  OntClass.<a href="../javadoc/com/hp/hpl/jena/ontology/OntClass.html#listRestrictionProperties(boolean)">listRestrictionProperties</a>( boolean all );
</pre>
  
<p>All of the above API methods return a Jena 
  <a href="../javadoc/com/hp/hpl/jena/util/ExtendedIterator.html"><code>ExtendedIterator</code></a>. One
  benefit of <code>ExtendedIterator</code>s is that they support concatentation. In particular, to 
  get a behaviour similar to <code>listDeclaredProperties</code> in Jena 2.1 and earlier, which 
  includes restriction properties among the results, users can do the following:</p>
  
<pre>
  OntClass c = ... ;   <em>// c is the class we are interested in</em>
  Iterator likeJena21 = c.listDeclaredProperties()
                         .andThen( c.listRestrictionProperties() );
</pre>

<p>A further difference from Jena 2.1 is that the models that are constructed without
  reasoners <em>will not</em> attempt to simulate the closure under inference. Users
  who wish the declared properties to include entailments will need to construct
  their models with one of the built-in or external reasoners. The difference is 
  illustrated by the following code fragment:</p>
