This document describes the Jena 2 reification API and how to use it.
Theer have been significant changes since Jena 1, so users of 
Jena 1's reification should read this document to see how to
translate their existing code to the new form.

<h2>creating reified statements</h2>

Reification in RDF and Jena is the ability to treat a Statement
as a Resource, and hence to make assertions <i>about</i> a
Statement. A Statement may be reified as many different
resources, allowing different manifestations ("statings") of
that Statement to be treated differently if required.

<p>A Statement is converted into a Resource using one of the 
methods

<ul>
<li>Statement::createReifiedStatement()</li>
<li>Statement::createReifiedStatement(String)</li>
<li>Model::createReifiedStatement(Statement)</li>
<li>Model::createReifiedStatement(String,Statement)</li>
</ul>

Each of these returns a <i>ReifiedStatement</i> object, which 
is a subtype of <i>Resource</i>. If the creation method passed
in a (non-null) <i>String</i>, the resource is a named resource
and that string is its URI. Otherwise the resource is a newly-minted
bnode. The methods on <i>Statement</i> create a reified statement
in that statements model; those on Model create a reified statement
in that model.

<p>It is not permitted for two different (non-equals) statements 
to be reified onto the same resource. An attempt to do so will 
generate an <i>AlreadyReifiedException</i>.

<p>The additional method <i>Model::getAnyReifiedStatement(Statement)</i>
returns some reification of the supplied <i>Statement</i>; an
existing one if possible, otherwise a fresh one (reified by a 
fresh bnode).

<p>The single method that <i>ReifiedStatement</i> adds to 
<i>Resource</i>is <code>getStatement()</code>, which delivers a 
<i>Statement</i> object <code>.equals()</code> to that used to create 
the reified statement.

So, to say something about some statement, we reify it and then make
an assertion about the resulting resource:

<pre>
    Model m = ModelFactory.createDefaultModel();
    RDFNode chris = m.createResource( "eg:people/chris" );
    Property P = m.createProperty( "eg:likes" );
    RDFNode O = m.createResource( "eg:tea" );
    Statement s = m.createStatement( chris, P, O );
    m.add( s );
    ReifiedStatement rs = s.createReifiedStatement();
    Property saidBy = m.createProperty( "eg:saidBy" );
    Statement about = m.createStatement( rs, saidBy, chris );
    m.add( about );
</pre>
 
<h2>finding reified statements</h2>

<h3>listing reified statements</h3>

There are three methods for listing reified statements:

<ul>
<li>Statement::listReifiedStatements()</li>
<li>Model::listReifiedStatements()</li>
<li>Model::listReifiedStatements(Statement)</li>
</ul>

Each of these returns an <i>RSIterator</i> object, which is an
iterator each of who's elements are <i>ReifiedStatement</i>s and
for which the convenience method <i>nextRS()</i> will deliver
a suitably-cast reified statement.

<p>The <i>Statement</i> method delivers all the reifications of
that statement in its model. The <i>Model</i> () method delivers
all reified statements in that model; the (Statement) method
delivers all reified statements which reify the argument.

<h3>converting resources to reified statements</h3>

If a resource <i>R</i> is associated with a reified statement,
but might not itself be a <i>ReifiedStatement</i> object, the
conversion method <i>RDFNode::as(Class)</i> can be used to
find (or create) a <i>ReifiedStatement</i>:

<ul><li>(ReifiedStatement) R.as(ReifiedStatement.class)</li></ul>

For example, a model that has been read in from an RDF/XML file
may have reified statements: knowing the name of the resource
allows a ReifiedStatement object to be constructed without
knowing the statement itself.

<p>If there is no such associated <i>ReifiedStatement</i>,
a <i>CannotReifyException</i> is thrown. To find out in
advance if the conversion is possible, use the predicate
<i>RDFNode::canAs(ReifiedStatement.class)</i>.

<h3>isReified()</h3>

<p>The methods <i>Statement::isReified()</i> and 
<i>Model::isreified(Statement)</i> return true if (and only if)
the statement has been reified in the model.



<h2>persistance and visibility</h2>

The reified statements of a model are written out with it. The
RDF implementation of a reified statement is as a quad of reification
statements: the statement <i>(S, P, O)</i>, reified by resource 
<i>R</i>, is represented by:

<ul>
<li>R rdf:type rdf:Statement</li>
<li>R rdf:subject S</li>
<li>R rdf:predicate P</li>
<li>R rdf:object O</li>
</ul>

However, these quads <i>need not be visible</i> in a Model;
they can be hidden to avoid them cluttering up the model. See
the later section on reification styles. Further, even if
they are visible, they need not be explicitly stored in the
Model as quads. In the current implementation, both memory-based
and RDB-based models will store complete reified statements 
"efficiently" rather than as reification quads.

<p>When a model is written out, the reification quads are
unpacked and written out as part of the model. When a model
with reification quads is read back in, the reified statements
are reconstituted from the quads in the input. 

<h2>removing reified statements</h2>

To remove reifications of a particular statement, either of

<ul>
<li>Statement::removeReification()</li>
<li>Model::removeAllReifications(Statement)</li>
</ul>

can be used. All the reified statements in the model that reify
the given statement are removed, whatever their associated resource.
To remove a particular reified statement only, use
<i>Model::removeReification(ReifiedStatement)</i>.

<h2>reification and Model::add(Model)</h2>

When one model is added to another, as well as the ordinary statements
of the model being added, the reified statements are copied across. If
this is not desired, there is a two-argument form:

<ul><li>Model::add(Model m, boolean suppress)</li></ul>

If <i>suppress</i> is <i>true</i>, then the reified statements are
not copied. (This choice arose from comments on earlier verions
of the Jena 2 API; users expected the reified statements to be copied.)

<h2>reification styles</h2>

There is a world of <i>ReifiedStatement</i>s, and a world of
reification quads. They have met, so far, only at input and output.

<p>Jena provides control over how reification quads interact with
<i>ReifiedStatements</i>. The first part of this control is through
the notion of a <i>reification style</i>, of which there are three:

<ul>
<li><i>Reifier.Minimal</i>: a Model with this style has no 
interaction between reification quads put into the model and its
<i>ReifiedStatement</i>s except on read and write. [This is
the style most similar to Jena 1.]
</li>

<li><i>Reifier.Standard</i>: a Model with this style will note
reification quads as they arrive in (or depart from) the Model 
and allow <i>ReifiedStatement</i>s to be built for complete
unambiguous quads. However, explicitly created reifications do
not materialise as quads.
</li>

<li><i>Reifier.Convenient</i>: as for <i>Standard</i>, except that
the quads do not appear in the Model at all.</li>
</ul>

If it's further required that all the reified statements be visible as
quads, the method <i>ModelFactory.withHiddenStatements(Model m)</i> produces
a new model which has the reified statements of <i>m</i> exposed as
reification quads.
