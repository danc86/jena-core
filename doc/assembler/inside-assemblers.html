<h1>inside assemblers</h1>

<p>
This document describes Jena's built-in assembler classes and
how to write and integrate your own assemblers. If you just need 
a quick guide to the common model specifications, see the
<a href="index.html">assembler quickstart</a>.
</p>
<h1>inside Assemblers</h1>

<p><code>Assembler.general</code> is a particular implementation of
the <code>Assembler</code> interface. An <code>Assembler</code> knows
how to build the objects -- not just models -- described by an Assembler
specification. The normal route into an Assembler is through the method:

<ul>
<li>open( Resource root ) ? Object</li>
</ul>

The Assembler inspects the <code>root</code> resource properties and
decides whether it can build an object with that description. If not,
it throws an exception. Otherwise, it constructs and returns a suitable
object.
</p>

<p>Since the creation of Models is the reason for the existance of
Assemblers, there is a convenience wrapper method:

<ul>
<li>openModel( Resource root ) ? Model</li>
</ul>

which constructs the object and checks that it's a Model before
returning it.
</p>

<p>When an <code>Assembler</code> requires sub-objects (for example,
when an InfModel Assembler requires a Reasoner object), it uses the
method:

<ul>
<li>open( Assembler sub, Resource root ) ? Model</li>
</ul>

passing in a suitable Assembler object. In fact the standard implementation
of <code>open(root)</code> is just

<ul>
<li>open( this, root )</li>
</ul>

passing in itself as the sub-assembler and having
<code>open(Assembler,Resource)</code> be the place where
all the work is done. (Amongst other things, this makes testing
easier.)
</p>

<p>When working with named persistent objects (typically database models),
sometimes you need to control whether new objects should be constructed
or old models can be reused. There is an additional method

<ul>
<li>open( Assembler sub, Resource root, Mode mode )</li>
</ul>

where the <code>Mode</code> argument controls the creation (or not)
of persistent models. The mode is passed down to all sub-object
creation. The standard implementation of <code>open(sub,root)</code>
is just:

<ul>
<li>open( sub, root, Mode.DEFAULT )</li>
</ul>

A <code>Mode</code> object has two methods:

<ul>
<li>permitCreateNew( Resource root, String name )</li>
<li>permitUseExisting( Resource root, String name )</li>
</ul>

<code>root</code> is the root resource describing the object to be
created or reused, and <code>name</code> is the name given to it.
The result is <code>true</code> iff the permission is granted.
<code>Mode.DEFAULT</code> permits the reuse of existing objects
and denies the creation of new ones.
</p>

<p>
There are four <code>Mode constants:</code>

<ul>
<li>Mode.DEFAULT - reuse existing objects</li>
<li>Mode.CREATE - create missing objects</li>
<li>Mode.REUSE - reuse existing objects</li>
<li>Mode.ANY - reuse existing objects, create missing ones</li>
</ul>

Since the <code>Mode</code> methods are passed the resource root and
name, the user can write specialised <code>Mode</code>s that look at
the name or the other root properties to make their decision.
</p>

<p>
Note that the Modes only apply to persistent objects, so <i>eg</i>
MemoryModels or PrefixMappings ignore their Mode arguments.
</p>

<h2>implementing your own assemblers</h2>

(Temporary documentation pasted in from email; will be
integrated and made nice RSN.)

<pre>
You have to implement the Assembler interface, most straightforwardly
done by subclassing AssemblerBase and overriding 

    public Object open( Assembler a, Resource root, Mode mode );

    because AssemblerBase both implements the boring methods that are
    just specialisations of `open` and provides some utility methods
    such as getting the values of unique properties. The arguments are

    * a -- the assembler to use for any sub-assemblies
    * root -- the resource in the assembler description for this object
    * mode -- the persistent open vs create mode

    The pattern is to look for the known properties of the root, use
    those to define any sub-objects of the object you're assembling
    (including using `a` for anything that's itself a structured
    object) and then constructing a new result object from those
    components. 

    Then you attach this new assembler object to its type in some
    AssemblerGroup using that group's `implementWith` method. You
    can attach it to the handy-but-public-and-shared group
    `Assembler.general` or you can construct your own group. The
    point about an AssemblerGroup is that it does the type-to-assembler
    mapping for you -- and when an AssemblerGroup calls a component
    assembler's `open` method, it passes /itself/ in as the `a` argument,
    so that the invoked assembler has access to all of the component
    assemblers of the Group.
</pre>


<h1>basic assemblers</h1>

<p>
There is a family of <i>basic assemblers</i>, each of which knows how to
assemble a specific kind of object so long as they're given an
Assembler that can construct their sub-objects. There are defined constants
in <code>Assembler</code> for (an instance of) each of these basic
assembler classes.

<p>
<code>Assembler.general</code> is an <i>assembler group</i>,
which ties together those basic assemblers. <code>general</code>
can be extended by Jena coders if required. Jena components that
use Assembler specifications to construct objects will use
<code>general</code> unless documented otherwise.
</p>

<p>
In the remaining sections we will discuss the <code>Assembler</code>
classes that return non-Model objects and conclude with a description
of <code>AssemblerGroup</code>.
</p>

<h2>basic assembler ContentAssembler</h2>

<p>The ContentAssembler constructs Content objects (using the
<code>ja:Content</code> vocabulary) used to supply
content to models. A Content object has the method:

<ul>
<li>fill( Model m ) ? m</li>
</ul>

Invoking the <code>fill</code> method adds the represented content to
the model. The supplied ModelAssemblers automatically apply
the <code>Content</code> objects corresponding to
<code>ja:content</code> property values.
</p>

<h2>basic assembler ConnectionAssembler</h2>

<p>A ConnectionAssembler constructs ConnectionDescriptions
according to the specification. An ConnectionDescription
retains the information required to make a database connection,
can constructs that connection on demand.</p>

<p>When a ConnectionAssembler is constructed, it may optionally
be given a Resource describing (using the JA vocabulary) default values
for any of the database properties. When that Assembler is used to
create a Connection, missing values are filled in from the defaults.
This allows sensitive information to be left out of the RDF description.
</p>

<p>The ConnectionAssembler embedded in Assembler.general has
defaults taken from the system properties <code>jena.dbUser</code>
and <code>jena.dbType</code>
</p>

<h2>basic assembler RulesetAssembler</h2>

<p>A RulesetAssembler generates lists of Jena rules.
</p>

<h2>basic assembler DefaultModelAssembler</h2>

<p>A "default model" is a model of unspecified type which is implemented as
whatever kind the assembler for <code>ja:DefaultModel</code> generates.
The default for a DefaultModel is to create a MemoryModel with no special
properties.
</p>

<h2>AssemblerGroup</h2>

<p>The AssemblerGroup class allows a bunch of other Assemblers to be
bundled together and selected by RDF type. AssemblerGroup implements
Assembler and adds the methods:</p>

<ul>
<li>implementWith( Resource type, Assembler a ) ? this</li>
<li>assemblerFor( Resource type ) ? Assembler</li>
</ul>

<p>AssemblerGroup's implementation of <code>open(sub,root)</code>
finds the <i>most specific type</i> of <code>root</code> that is a subclass
of <code>ja:Object</code> and looks for the Assembler that has been
associated with that type by a call of <code>implementWith</code>.
It then delegates construction to that
Assembler, passing <i>itself</i> as the sub-assembler. Hence each
component Assembler only needs to know how to assemble its own
particular objects.
</p>

<p>The <code>assemblerFor</code> method returns the assembler associated
with the argument type by a previous call of <code>implementWith</code>,
or <code>null</code> if there is no associated assembler.</p>

<h3><a id="loading-assembler-classes">loading assembler classes</a></h3>

<p>
AssemblerGroups implement the <code>ja:assembler</code> functionality.
The object of an <code>(type ja:assembler "ClassName")</code> statement
is a string which is taken as the name of an <code>Assembler</code>
implementation to load. An instance of that class is associated with
<code>type</code> using <code>implementWith</code>.
</p>

<p>If the class has a constructor that takes a single <code>Resource</code>
object, that constructor is used to initialise the class, passing in the
<code>type</code> subject of the triple. Otherwise the no-argument
constructor of the class is used.
</p>
