=========

ARP 1_5_0 shipping with Jena 1.5.0
  + also will be shipped standalone
  
September 2001.
==============

ARP 1_0_5 shipping with Jena 2.0.0


ARP versions 1_0_4 and earlier:
  + ship as standalone parsers
  + are not integrated with Jena
  + support Jena version 1.1.0 only

ARP version 1_0_5:
  + ships 
    both as a standalone parser 
    and integrated with Jena 1.2.0
  + supports Jena 1.1.0 and 1.2.0

Future updates
==============

Only major updates to ARP are shipped standalone.

The following functionality is desired in future 
releases:
+ support for normalizing transcoders (Java 1.4.X only)
+ single threaded (using Xerces 2)
+ better detection of common misuse
  (incorrect rdf namespace; incorrect use of java Readers).

Future major release
====================

The planned Jena 2.0.0 release is backwardly incompatible.
Hence:

  Old ARP versions will not work with the Jena 2.0.0.
  Jena 2.0.0 will contain an integrated new release of ARP 
  that will not work with Jena 1.X.X.


New versions of ARP should continue to exhibit backwards
compatibility with old versions of ARP for non-Jena users.
