These sources build a document showing how triple
tables correspond to the OWL Abstract Syntax, and
a file Grammar.java in the source tree, which enocdes
those triple tables.

The file precompute.c must be compile to precompute 
(linux) or precompute.exe (windows).

SWI-Prolog is used with the commands:
  [load].
  compMapping.
  gogo.


It takes a little while.

Other prologs should be usability but some porting
would be needed.

The prolog sources were in the main produced by Jeremy
as part of the W3C work see:
