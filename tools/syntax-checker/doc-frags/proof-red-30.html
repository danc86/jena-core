We now consider the case where the explicit type is a blank node.
</p>
%%lemma('blank explicit type reduction').
<dd>
If <em>g</em> is an acceptable graph
containing some explicit type triple <em>tr</em>
with uriref subject <em>n</em>
which appears in no other triple, except for other
explicit type triples,
 and the object of <em>tr</em> is a blank node <em>b</em>,
then <em>g</em>
can be reduced by removing that triple.
</dd>
<dt>Proof:</dt>
<dd>
As before, <em>h</em> is acceptable.
<br />
<em>b</em>
must be 
%%dl_only(Lvl,'a description or').
 a restriction (by inspection
of the triple tables). 
We use the table below to find a directive corresponding
to <em>tr</em>. Each entry contains one unexpanded nonterminal
from the abstract syntax grammar; this being 
%%dl_only(Lvl,either).
 <code>restriction</code> 
%%dl_only(Lvl,'or <code>description</code>').
.
Since <em>b</em> is 
the
<a href="triples.html#one-object"> object of at most one triple</a>
 in <em>g</em>,
and that triple is <em>tr</em> which is not in <em>h</em>, we have
that <em>b</em> is not the object of any triple in <em>h</em>.
Hence, the 
%%linkLemma(description).  applies and a directive
<em>d</em>
in any abstract syntax tree corresponding to <em>h</em>
corresponds to <em>d</em>.
Thus a new abstract syntax tree can be formed, by cutting <em>d</em> 
from the old tree and pasting it into the partially unexpanded directive,
and adding this new directive into the tree.
