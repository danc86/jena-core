<p>
The table below shows nondeterministic rules
for transforming an abstract syntax tree into
an RDF graph.
</p>
<p>
The rules produce triples as side effects.
</p>
<p>
Each rule takes 0 or 1 arguments, and may return
a result. Such arguments or results are
 nodes in the resulting graph. The argument allows for downwards propogation
of nodes, whereas the result allows for upwards propogation.
</p>
<p>
Where the abstract syntax form has optional or repeated elements
the corresponding part of the mapping rule is optional or repeated (or one of the
 special sequence rules).
</p>
<p>
The symbols in the rules either directly reflect abstract syntax trees, or
reflect terms from the grammar to refer to
 a tree portion generated by the corresponding rule.
When two or three tree portions are generated by 
the same rule subscripts are used to disambiguate.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<dl>
<dt><a name="note-directive" id="note-directive">directive</a></dt>
<dd>In many parts of the mapping rules, it is necessary to
expand the nonterminal symbols from the abstract syntax
in order to apply the recursive transformation.
</dd>
<dt><a name="note-prop" id="note-prop">prop</a></dt>
<dd>Triples of the form
<pre>
<em>subj</em> rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty .
</pre>
are optional, but may only be omitted when
the complete transformation generates one of the 
following triples:
<pre>
<em>subj</em> rdf:type owl:SymmetricProperty .
<em>subj</em> rdf:type owl:TransitiveProperty .
<em>subj</em> rdf:type owl:InverseFunctionalProperty .
</pre>
</dd>
<dt><a name="note-thing" id="note-thing">thing</a></dt>
<dd>Triples of the form
<pre>
<em>subj</em> rdf:type owl:Thing .
</pre>
are optional, but may only be omitted when
the complete transformation generates some <code>rdf:type</code> triple
with the same subject.
