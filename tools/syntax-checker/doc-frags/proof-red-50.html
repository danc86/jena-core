Triples with a ground subject and blank object

can be treated failry similarly; using the 
%%linkLemma(description). 
or the
%%linkLemma('unnamed individual'). .
We refer to these triples as Ground-Ground-Blank (GGB)  triples.

%%lemma('GGB Triple Reduction').
<dd>
If <em>g</em> is an acceptable graph
containing a triple <em>tr</em>,
with ground subject, and blank object <em>b</em>, such that:
<em>b</em> does not have explicit type
<code>rdf:List</code>;
and <em>tr</em> 
is not an explicit type triple, then <em>g</em>
can be reduced by removing that triple.
</dd>
<dt>Proof:</dt>
<dd>
As before, <em>h</em> is acceptable.
<br />
Take an abstract syntax tree <em>t</em> corresponding to <em>h</em>.

By inspection of the triple table <em>b</em> must 
have category unnamedIndividual,
%%dl_only(Lvl,'unnamedDataRange, description').
or restriction.
Similarly to in the
%%linkLemma('blank explicit type reduction').
using either  the %%linkLemma(description).
 or the 
%%linkLemma('unnamed individual').
we find a directive <em>d</em>
in <em>t</em> corresponding to <em>b</em>.
We can form a tree corresponding to <em>g</em> by:
<ul>
<li>finding <em>tr</em> in the table below.
</li>
<li>modify the directive found in the table
by substituting <em>d</em> appropriately.
</li>
<li>modifying <em>t</em> by 
deleting <em>d</em> and adding the new directive
modified from the table below.
</li>
</ul>
