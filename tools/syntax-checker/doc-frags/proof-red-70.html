We now consider the case where the
first item in the list is a blank node.
</p>
%%lemma('Second List Reduction').
<dd>
If <em>g</em> is an acceptable graph
containing a node <em>n</em>
of explicit type <code>rdf:List</code>
such that <em>n</em> is not the object of
a triple with predicate <code>rdf:rest</code>,
and <em>n</em> is the subject of
 a triple with predicate <code>rdf:first</code>
and a blank object <em>bbb</em>, then it is reducible.
</dd>
<dt>Proof:</dt>
<dd>
We construct <em>h</em> similarly to the 
%%linkLemma('first list reduction').
.
The triples
<pre>
<em>sss ppp n</em> .
<em>n</em> <code>rdf:type rdf:List</code> .
<em>n</em> <code>rdf:first</code> <em>bbb</em> .
<em>n</em> <code>rdf:rest</code> <em>lll</em> .
</pre>
found in <em>g</em> are replaced by the single triple:
<pre>
<em>sss ppp lll</em> .
</pre>
in <em>h</em>.


<em>h</em> similarly is acceptable. However, since <em>bbb</em> is blank,
the node <em>n</em> must be of category listOfDescription.
So <em>ppp</em> must be <code>owl:intersectionOf</code> 
%%dl_only(Lvl,'or <code>owl:unionOf</code>'). 
.
<br />
Given an abstract syntax tree <em>t</em> corresponding to
<em>h</em> As in lemma 1 the mapping rule that invoked the rule that
created <em>lll</em> must be one of <span class="todo">add smaller list of rules</span>.
<br />
In each of these rules, the sequence construct arises from a repeated
construct in an abstract syntax rule of
%%dl_only(Lvl,'{ description } or ').
{ Super( description ) }.
<br />
Since <em>bbb</em> is the 
<a href="triples.html#one-object">object of at most one triple</a> 
in <em>g</em>
and that triple has been deleted, it is not the object of any triple
in <em>h</em> and the %%linkLemma(description). applies.
Thus we can
modify <em>t</em> by cutting the top-level 
%%dl_only(Lvl,'description or ').
restriction
that
corresponds to <em>bbb</em> and pasting it 
at the beginning of the appropriate matching subtree,
possibly inside a <code>Super(&nbsp;)</code> construct.
The resulting abstract syntax tree corresponds to <em>g</em>.
