<p>
This paper presents a revised version of the syntax for OWL Lite
and OWL DL.
</p>
<p>
The differences from the published Abstract Syntax are
slight; the differences in the mapping rules are
greater; the expression of OWL Lite and OWL DL
as RDF graphs is completely different. The latter
motivates most of the other differences. 
</p>
<p>
There are also differences arising from:
 </p>
<ul>
<li>bug fixes over
the published syntax
</li>
<li>
a desire for greater compatibility between OWL Lite
and RDF(S) than in the published syntax
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The syntaxes used in this paper are processed
using
<a href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/">SWI-Prolog</a>;
specifically the triple tables are generated from
the abstract syntax and mapping rules.

<p>
It is also possible to modify the grammars
and rerun to get different tables etc.
However, the separation between the program and
the grammars is not as clean as I would like, and 
some aspects of the grammar are builtin to the program.
(e.g. the start symbol, some of the categories).

<h3>To Do List</h3>
<p>Update diff list</p>
<p>Modify proof for datatypes ... currently slightly buggy.</p>


<p>
The main item on the to-do list is
correspondences proofs.
</p>
<dl>
<dt>Ground Triples</dt>
<dd>
The key to the proofs is a table which for each 
triple without blank nodes gives a corresponding
abstract syntax directive that generates 
precisely that triple
and explicit type triples.
</dd>
<dt>Triples with unnamedIndividuals</dt>
<dd>
A further table is needed showing how 
to add a single triple involving unnamedIndividuals.
An inductive hypothesis allows the smaller graph
to already have an abstract syntax form.
</dd>
<dt>Triples with rdf:List</dt>
<dd>
A further table is needed showing how 
to add three triples forming the first element
in an rdf:List, in any of its possible locations.
An inductive hypothesis allows the smaller graph
to already have an abstract syntax form.
</dd>
<dt>Triples with other blank nodes</dt>
<dd>
A further table is needed showing how 
to add any of the other blank nodes
first as a top-level directive
and then as the object of some other triple.
</dd>
