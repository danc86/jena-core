<p>
We also consider some cases where a restriction or
description has a second restriction or description embedded
within it.
</p>
%%lemma('Second Structure Reduction').
<dd>
If <em>g</em> is an acceptable graph
containing a blank node <em>n</em> such that:
<em>n</em> is of category 
description or restriction; 
there is exactly one triple
with subject <em>n</em> with object being
a blank node <em>b</em>;
<em>b</em> is of
category description or restriction;
<em>n</em> is not the object of any triple;
<em>n</em> is not the subject of a triple with predicate
<code>owl:equivalentClass</code> or <code>owl:disjointWith</code>.
Then <em>g</em> can be reduced by removing
all the triples involving <em>n</em> to form <em>h</em>.
</dd>
<dt>Proof:</dt>
<dd>
As before, <em>h</em> is acceptable.
<br />
Given an abstract syntax tree <em>t</em>
corresponding to <em>h</em>, as
in the %%linkLemma('Blank Explicit Type Reduction'). we can find a 
directive <em>d</em> that corresponds to <em>b</em>.
We use the table below to look up the node <em>n</em>,
and find a directive, into which we substitute
the directive <em>d</em> appropriately.
We then modify <em>t</em> by deleting <em>d</em> and
adding the new modified directive from the table.
This then corresponds to <em>g</em>.
