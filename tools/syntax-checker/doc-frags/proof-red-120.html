We finally consider the case of a restriction or
description compared with some other node.
</p>
%%lemma('Description Comparison Reduction').
<dd>
If <em>g</em> is an acceptable graph
containing a blank node <em>n</em> such that:
there is a triple <em>tr</em>
with subject <em>n</em> and with predicate <code>owl:equivalentClass</code>
or <code>owl:disjointWith</code>;
<em>tr</em> has object <em>b</em>.
Then <em>g</em> can be reduced by removing
 <em>tr</em> to form <em>h</em>.
</dd>
<dt>Proof:</dt>
<dd>
The only triples in the triple tables
matching <em>tr</em> are ones in which <em>n</em> is of category 
description or restriction.
<br />
We note that <em>n</em> meets the <a href="triples.html#structural">structural constraints</a>
 in <em>h</em>,
because it meets those constraints in <em>g</em> and the deleted triple
is not relevant to those constraints.
Thus, as before, <em>h</em> is acceptable.
<br />

Given an abstract syntax tree <em>t</em>
corresponding to <em>h</em>, as
in the
 %%linkLemma('Blank Explicit Type Reduction'). 
we can find a 
directive <em>d<sub>1</sub></em> in <em>t</em> that corresponds to <em>n</em>.
Note, that since <em>g</em> is appropriate, and <em>n</em> is the subject
of an <code>owl:equivalentClass</code> or <code>owl:disjointWith</code>
triple, then <em>n</em> is not the object of any triple in neither
<em>g</em> nor <em>h</em>.
If <em>b</em> is blank, then it is a restriction or description node,
and we similarly can find a directive  
<em>d<sub>2</sub></em> in <em>t</em> that corresponds to <em>b</em>.
We use the table below to look up the triple <em>tr</em>,
and find a directive, into which we substitute
the description or restriction <em>d<sub>1</sub></em> and either the classID uriref
<em>b</em> or the description or restriction <em>d<sub>2</sub></em> appropriately.
We then modify <em>t</em> by adding the new modified directive 
and by deleting <em>d<sub>1</sub></em>,
and if applicable <em>d<sub>2</sub></em>.
This then corresponds to <em>g</em>.
