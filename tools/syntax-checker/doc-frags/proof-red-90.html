<p>
We now consider some other triples with
an unnamed individual as subject and a blank node
as object
</p>
%%lemma('Second Unnamed Individual Triple Reduction').
<dd>
If <em>g</em> is an acceptable graph
containing a triple <em>tr</em>
with subject <em>n</em> such that:
<em>n</em>
is an unnamed individual;
there is some other explicit type triple for <em>n</em> in <em>g</em>;
 <em>tr</em> has a blank node <em>b</em> as object;
 and <em>n</em> is not the object of any triple,
then <em>g</em>
can be reduced by removing <em>tr</em>.
</dd>
<dt>Proof:</dt>
<dd>
<em>h</em> is acceptable, as in
%%linkLemma('first unnamed Individual triple Reduction').
.
<br />
Take an abstract syntax tree <em>t</em> corresponding to <em>h</em>.
By inspection of the triple table <em>b</em> must 
have category unnamedIndividual%%dl_only(Lvl,', description'). 

or
restriction 
and so by the %%linkLemma(description).
 or the 
%%linkLemma('unnamed individual').

we find a directive <em>d</em>
in <em>t</em> corresponding to <em>b</em>.
We can form a tree corresponding to <em>g</em> by:
<ul>
<li>finding <em>tr</em> in the table below.
</li>
<li>modify the syntax expression found in the table
by substituting <em>d</em> appropriately.
</li>
<li>using the %%linkLemma('unnamed individual'). to find
the directive in <em>t</em> corresponding to
<em>n</em>, this has form <code>Individual( &hellip; )</code>.
</li>
<li>modifying <em>t</em> by adding into the <code>Individual( &hellip; )</code>
expression the modified syntactic expression from the table below.
</li>
</ul>
