<p>
This section shows that the definition of a <a href="triples.html">graph as triples</a>
is sufficient to ensure that the graph also falls under the definition of
a graph via the <a href="syntax.html">abstract syntax</a> and the <a href="mapping.html">mapping rules</a>.
</p>
<p>We start by defining terms, and then move into the proof.</p>
<dl>
<dt>acceptable</dt>
<dd>An RDF graph is accceptable if it meets the constraints specified for
a <a href="triples.html">graph as triples</a></dd>
<dt>mappable</dt>
<dd>An RDF graph is mappable if there is an abstract syntax
tree in the abstract ontology that maps to it.</dd>

<dt>correspondences between abstract syntax trees and node categorizations</dt>
<dd>
A correspondence is a 3-tuple
<code>&lt; <em>g</em>, <em>t</em>, <em>C</em> ></code>
where <em>g</em> is
a graph which is both acceptable and mappable,
<em>t</em> is an abstract syntax tree that maps to <em>g</em>,
and <em>C</em> is a 
<a href="triples.html#uri-category">categorization</a> 
of the nodes of <em>g</em>
which shows that it is acceptable.
Moreover, in a correspondence, 
every uriref has the same categorization
in the abstract syntax as in <em>C</em>.
</dd>
<dt>corresponds</dt>
<dd>An acceptable graph <em>g</em>, with categorization <em>C</em> corresponds to an 
abstract syntax tree
<em>t</em>
if there is a correspondence 
<code>&lt; <em>g</em>, <em>t</em>, <em>C</em> ></code>.
Under such a correspondence a subtree <em>u</em> of <em>t</em> corresponds to
a node <em>n</em> in <em>g</em> if the mapping of <em>t</em> involves
mapping <em>u</em> and returning <em>n</em>.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
The goal of this section is to show that a graph is
acceptable iff it is mappable.
However, due to time pressure, I omit showing that
mappable graphs are acceptable: this is the easier 
direction since the triple tables have been generated
from the mapping rules.
Hence, we aim to show the following:
</p>
%%theorem('Sufficiency').

<dd>
 Every acceptable graph is mappable.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
In fact the following stronger result is proved:
</p>
%%theorem('Correspondence').
<dd>
Every acceptable graph corresponds to 
an abstract syntax tree.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
The structure of the proof is inductive.
The initial case from which the induction starts is
the empty graph.
</p>
%%lemma('Empty Graph').
<dd>
The empty graph corresponds to <code>Ontology()</code>.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
The inductive step involves a number of distinct cases.
To structure the proof we introduce the concept of <em>reducible</em>.
</p>
<dl>
<dt>reducibility</dt>
<dd>
An acceptable graph <em>g</em> is reducible, if there is a 
related 
graph <em>h</em> with fewer triples, which is also acceptable,
such that if <em>h</em> corresponds to <em>t</em>
then <em>g</em> corresponds to some defined transformation
of <em>t</em>.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Usually <em>h</em> is a proper subgraph of <em>g</em>.
</p>
<p>
The rest of this section gives:
 <ol>
<li>Reduction lemmas,
each
showing that an acceptable graph with a certain characteristic
is reducible.
</li>
<li>Structural lemmas, which combine the reduction lemmas
paying special attention to the structure of the blank nodes.
</li>
<li>
The proof of the main theorem, which simply combines the structural
lemmas with the reduction lemmas into an inductive argument.
</li>
</ol>
