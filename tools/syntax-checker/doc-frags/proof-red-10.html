Before we start on the reduction lemmas, we present three results
that are frequently needed.
</p>
%%lemma('Description').
<dd>
If a graph <em>g</em> corresponds to <em>t</em>
and contains
%%dl_only(Lvl,'a description, an unnamedDataRange or').
 a restriction node <em>n</em>  
that is not the object of any
triple then <em>n</em> corresponds to
a directive in <em>t</em>
</dd>
<dt>Proof:</dt>
<dd>
<em>n</em> is blank and
hence must arise from one of the mapping rules
that introduces a blank node. Moreover, by considering
the <code>rdf:type</code> triples with <em>n</em> as subject,
the only mapping rules to consider are those
for the %%dl_only(Lvl,'description dataRange or').
 restriction construct from the abstract
syntax.
<br/>
These mapping rules can only be invoked in certain contexts
<span class="todo">[ ... enumerate contexts, automatic needed? ... ]</span>;
in all of these the returned node becomes the object of a triple,
except for the context transforming a directive within the
ontology construct <span class="todo">link to mapping rule</span>.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
A similar result holds for unnamed individuals.
</p>
%%lemma('Unnamed Individual').
<dd>
If a graph <em>g</em> corresponds to <em>t</em>
and contains
an unnamedIndividual node <em>n</em>  
that is not the object of any
triple then <em>n</em> corresponds to
a directive in <em>t</em>
</dd>
<dt>Proof:</dt>
<dd>
<em>n</em> is blank and
hence must arise from one of the mapping rules
that introduces a blank node. Moreover, by considering
the <code>rdf:type</code> triples with <em>n</em> as subject,
the only mapping rules to consider are those
for the individual construct from the abstract
syntax.
<br/>
These mapping rules can only be invoked in certain contexts
<span class="todo">[ ... enumerate contexts, automatic needed? ... ]</span>;
in all of these the returned node becomes the object of a triple,
except for the context transforming a directive within the
ontology construct <span class="todo">link to mapping rule</span>.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
The reduction lemmas all involve taking a subgraph of an acceptable
graph. Most subgraphs of acceptable graphs are themselves acceptable.
The precise relationship is:
</p>
%%lemma('Subgraph').
<dd>
Given a graph <em>h</em> such that:
<ul>
<li><em>h</em> is a subgraph of an acceptable graph <em>g</em></li>
<li>Every non-literal, 
non-<a href="syntax.html#builtin-urirefs">built-in</a> node in <em>h</em>
is
<a href="triples.html#explicit-type">explicitly typed.</a>
</li>
<li><em>h</em> satisfies 
<a href="triples.html#structural">the additional 
structural 
requirements on blank nodes</a>.
</li>
</ul>
Then <em>h</em> is acceptable.
</dd>
<dt>Proof:</dt>
<dd>Given an acceptable graph <em>g</em> with
subgraph <em>h</em>, take the 
<a href="triples.html#uri-category">categorization</a> of 
the nodes of <em>g</em> and restrict it to be 
a <a href="triples.html#uri-category">categorization</a> of the nodes of <em>h</em>.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
In a typical mapping of an abstract syntax tree,
explicit type triples get generated many times over.
To avoid complications from this we use the following result.
</p>
%%lemma('Explicit Type').
<dd>
If <em>n</em> is a node in an acceptable graph <em>g</em>
then either <em>n</em> is a builtin uriref or when it
 has a category found in the table
below <em>g</em> contains an explicit type triple as shown.
</dd>
<dt>Proof:</dt>
<dd>By the first condition on acceptable graphs 
there is some such an explicit type triple, moreover
it cannot have object 
<code>rdf:Property</code>,
<code>rdfs:Class</code>,
<code>owl:FunctionalProperty</code>,
<code>owl:DeprecatedProperty</code>,
<code>owl:DeprecatedClass</code>, and must appear
in one of the triple tables.
By inspection of the triple tables,
many categories have only one such explicit type triple
and these are listed below.
</dd>
</dl>
