Other ground triples can be treated similarly.

%%lemma('Ground Triple Reduction').
<dd>
If <em>g</em> is an acceptable graph
containing a ground triple <em>tr</em>,
which is not an explicit type triple, then <em>g</em>
can be reduced by removing that triple.
</dd>
<dt>Proof:</dt>
<dd>
As before, <em>h</em> is acceptable.
<br />
We use the table below, to look up the triple <em>tr</em>
and find a directive to be added
to an abstract syntax tree corresponding to <em>h</em>,
to form an abstract syntax tree corresponding to <em>g</em>.
<br />
This table has been constructed such that the directives
map to the given ground triple and
possibly explicit type triples that are known to 
be in <em>g</em> by the 
%%linkLemma('explicit type'). 
.
