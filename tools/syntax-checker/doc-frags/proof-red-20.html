The typical reduction lemma has an acceptable
graph <em>g</em> and a subgraph <em>h</em>.
We need to show that <em>h</em> is acceptable, and
that given a correspondence involving <em>h</em> we can form 
a correspondence of <em>g</em>.
Using the %%linkLemma(subgraph). we only need to consider whether <em>h</em>
is explicitly typed and whether the blank nodes in <em>h</em>
meet the <a href="triples.html#structural">structural requirements</a>. 
Such requirements
on a blank  node <em>b</em> in <em>h</em>
are characterised by the set of triples with <em>b</em> as their subject.
</p>
<p>
Most nodes in an acceptable graph require explicit type triples.
In general, the induction works by first reducing all other triples
involving a node, and then by reducing the explicit type triple.
This does not work for most blank nodes which are treated differently.
</p>
<p>We first consider the case where of a ground explicit type triple.</p>
%%lemma('Ground Explicit Type Reduction').
<dd>
If <em>g</em> is an acceptable graph
containing some ground, explicit type triple <em>tr</em>
with subject <em>n</em>
which appears in no other triple, except other explicit type triples, 
then <em>g</em>
can be reduced by removing that triple.
</dd>
<dt>Proof:</dt>
<dd>
Let <em>h</em> be <em>g</em> - { <em>tr</em> }.
Every node in <em>h</em> is explicitly typed in <em>g</em>
and hence also explicitly typed in <em>h</em> (if <em>n</em> is
in <em>h</em>, then it has multiple explicit type triples in <em>g</em>
and hence has at least
one
of them in <em>h</em>).
For any  blank node
<em>b</em> in <em>h</em>  the set:
<br />
{ <em>s</em> : <em>s</em> &isin; <em>h</em>, <em>s</em> has subject <em>b</em> }
<br />
is the same as the set:
<br />
{ <em>s</em> : <em>s</em> &isin; <em>g</em>, <em>s</em> has subject <em>b</em> }
<br />
Since <em>g</em> is acceptable, this set of triples
meets the <a href="triples.html#structural">structural requirements</a>.

So by the %%linkLemma(subgraph).
,
<em>h</em> is acceptable.
<br />
We use the table 
below to look up the triple and find a directive in the abstract syntax.
This table has been constructed such that the directives
map to the given explicit type triple and
possibly other explicit type triples that are required by the
%%linkLemma('explicit type').
.
Given an abstract syntax tree corresponding to <em>h</em>
we can form a tree corresponding to <em>g</em> by adding the additional
directive found in the table.
