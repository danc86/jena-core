<p>
We now consider unnamedIndividual nodes.
These behave quite similarly to individualID nodes,
but need to be treated slightly differently.
With individualIDs the uriref can link multiple
directives in the abstract syntax; with unnamed individuals
it is necessary to ensure that everything that
needs to be said about the individual is said in a single 
directive.
</p>
<p>Nearly as before, we first consider a solitary explicit type triple,
dividing it into two cases: a named or an unnamed type.
Then we consider the other triples (including multiple explicit type triples).
</p>
<p>We first consider the case where the type is not a blank node</p>
%%lemma('First Unnamed Individual Explicit Type Reduction').
<dd>
If <em>g</em> is an acceptable graph
containing some explicit type triple <em>tr</em>
with subject <em>n</em>
which is an unnamed individual,
and has a uriref node as object, and
<em>n</em> appears in no other triple, then <em>g</em>
can be reduced by removing that triple.
</dd>
<dt>Proof:</dt>
<dd>
Let <em>h</em> be <em>g</em> - { <em>tr</em> }.
Every node in <em>h</em> is explicitly typed in <em>g</em>
and hence also explicitly typed in <em>h</em> (<em>n</em> is
not in <em>h</em>).
For any  blank node
<em>b</em> in <em>h</em>  the set:
<br />
{ <em>s</em> : <em>s</em> &isin; <em>h</em>, <em>s</em> has subject <em>b</em> }
<br />
is the same as the set:
<br />
{ <em>s</em> : <em>s</em> &isin; <em>g</em>, <em>s</em> has subject <em>b</em> }
<br />
Since <em>g</em> is acceptable, this set of triples
meets the <a href="triples.html#structural">structural requirements</a>,
and by the %%linkLemma(subgraph). ,
<em>h</em> is acceptable.
<br />
Given an abstract syntax tree corresponding to <em>h</em>
we can form a tree corresponding to <em>g</em> by adding the additional
directive <code>Individual(Type(classID))</code> where <code>classID</code>
is the object of the <code>tr</code>. This new tree corresponds to <em>g</em>.
</dl>


<p>The case where the type is a blank node is similar.</p>
%%lemma('Second Unnamed Individual Explicit Type Reduction').
<dd>
If <em>g</em> is an acceptable graph
containing some explicit type triple <em>tr</em>
with subject <em>n</em>
which is an unnamed individual,
and has a blank node as object, and
<em>n</em> appears in no other triple, then <em>g</em>
can be reduced by removing that triple.
</dd>
<dt>Proof:</dt>
<dd>

 <em>h</em> is acceptable as before.
<br />
Given an abstract syntax tree <em>t</em> corresponding to <em>h</em>,
as in the %%linkLemma('blank explicit type reduction'). , we can find a 
directive in <em>t</em> which corresponds to the type of <em>n</em>.
We can form a tree corresponding to <em>g</em> from <em>t</em>
by deleting that directive
and adding the additional  
directive <code>Individual(Type(<em>expr</em>))</code> where <code><em>expr</em></code>
is the restriction or description directive deleted from <em>t</em>. 
This new tree corresponds to <em>g</em>.
</dl>


<p>We now consider some other triples with
an unnamed individual as subject and a uriref or literal
as object
</p>
%%lemma('First Unnamed Individual Triple Reduction').
<dd>
If <em>g</em> is an acceptable graph
containing a triple <em>tr</em>
with subject <em>n</em> such that:
<em>n</em>
which is an unnamed individual;
there is some other explicit type triple for <em>n</em> in <em>g</em>;
 <em>tr</em> has a uriref or literal node as object;
 and <em>n</em> is not the object of any triple,
then <em>g</em>
can be reduced by removing <em>tr</em>.
</dd>
<dt>Proof:</dt>
<dd>
We show <em>h</em> is acceptable, as in
%%linkLemma('first unnamed Individual Explicit Type Reduction').
,  with the following additional considerations.
<em>n</em> does have an explicit type in <em>h</em>,
moreover since it has category unnamedIndividual, it does
not violate the <a href="triples.html#structural">structural constraints</a>.
<br />
Given an abstract syntax tree <em>t</em> corresponding to <em>h</em>
we can form a tree corresponding to <em>g</em> by:
<ul>
<li>finding <em>tr</em> in the table below
</li>
<li>using the %%linkLemma('unnamed individual'). to find
the directive in <em>t</em> corresponding to
<em>n</em>, this has form <code>Individual( &hellip; )</code>.
</li>
<li>modifying <em>t</em> by adding into the <code>Individual( &hellip; )</code>
expression the syntactic expression found with <em>tr</em>
in the table below.
</li>
</ul>
