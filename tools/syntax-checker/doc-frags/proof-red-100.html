We now consider some other blank nodes.

%%lemma('First Structure Reduction').
<dd>
If <em>g</em> is an acceptable graph
containing a blank node <em>n</em> such that:
<em>n</em> is of category 
allDifferent%%dl_only(Lvl,', unnamedDataRange, description or ').
restriction; 
there are no triples 
with subject <em>n</em> and object being
a blank node;
<em>n</em> is not the object of any 
triple%%dl_only(Lvl,'; <em>n</em> is not the subject of a triple with predicate
<code>owl:equivalentClass</code> or <code>owl:disjointWith</code>').
.
Then <em>g</em> can be reduced by removing
all the triples involving <em>n</em>.
</dd>
<dt>Proof:</dt>
<dd>
As before, <em>h</em> is acceptable.
<br />
The triple tables impose significant
structural requirements on
all nodes satisfying the premises of this lemma.
The table below gives an exhaustive listing of
the possibilties, along with a corresponding directive
from the abstract syntax.
<br />
As before we can modify an
abstract syntax tree corresponding to <em>h</em>
by adding the appropriate directive, to get an
abstract syntax tree corresponding to <em>g</em>.
