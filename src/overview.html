Overview documentation for Jena - a Java toolkit for processing RDF.
</p>
<h2>Summary of features</h2>

<p>Jena is Java API for manipulating RDF models. Its features include: </p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>statement centric methods for manipulating an RDF model as a set of RDF
      triples
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>resource centric methods for manipulating an RDF model as a set of resources
      with properties
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>cascading method calls for more convenient programming
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>built-in support for RDF containers - bag, alt and seq
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>enhanced resources - the application can extend the behaviour of resources
  </li>
  <li>integrated parsers (ARP and David Megginson's RDFFilter)</li>
</ul>
<p>This latest release of the jena toolkit integrates a number of new components,
  some of which are also available separately:</p>
<ul>
  <li>new ARP parser compliant with latest working group recommendations</li>
  <li>integrated query language (RDQL)</li>
  <li>support for storing DAML ontologies in a model</li>
  <li>persistent storage module based on Berkeley DB</li>
  <li>open architecture supporting other storage implementations</li>
</ul>
<p>The current release, 1.2.0, is a <b>preview</b> release. We hope it as stable
  and functional as jena always has been and should be backward compatible with
  previous releases. In the <b>next release</b> we would like to make various
  changes, such as cleaning up some features of the API and shortening the package
  names, which will require changes to existing code. Ideally we'd to make all
  such changes in one go to minimise the number of times people have to tweak
  their client code. Hence we are putting out this preview release now. Any suggestions
  you have for changes to the API - now is a good time to make them! Send them
  to the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/jena-dev">discussion list</a>.</p>
<p> More recent versions may be available from the Jena web site - <a href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/semweb/">http://www.hpl.hp.com/semweb</a>.
