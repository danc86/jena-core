/** An RDF Model.
 *
 * <p>An RDF model is a set of Statements.  Methods are provided for creating
 * resources, properties and literals and the Statements which link them,
 * for adding statements to and removing them from a model, for
 * querying a model and set operations for combining models.</p>
 * <P>This interface defines a set of primitive methods.  A set of
 * convenience methods which extends this interface, e.g. performing
 * automatic type conversions and support for enhanced resources,
 * is defined in {@link ModelCon}.</P>
 *
 * <h2>System Properties</h2>
 *
 *
 * <h3>Firewalls and Proxies</h3>
 *
 * <p>Some of the methods, e.g. the read methods, may have to traverse a
 * firewall.  This can be accomplished using the standard java method
 * of setting system properties.  To use a socks proxy, include on the
 * java command line:</p>
 * <blockquote>
 *   -DsocksProxyHost=[your-proxy-domain-name-or-ip-address]
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * <p>To use an http proxy, include on the command line:</p>
 * <blockquote>
 * -DproxySet=true -DproxyHost=[your-proxy] -DproxyPort=[your-proxy-port-number]
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * <p>Alternatively, these properties can be set programatically, e.g.</p>
 *
 * <code><pre>
 *   System.getProperties().put("proxySet","true");
 *   System.getProperties().put("proxyHost","proxy.hostname");
 *   System.getProperties().put("proxyPort",port_number);
 * </pre></code>
