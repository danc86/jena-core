    The revised and soon-to-be-core interface for sources of models,
    typically generated from RDF descriptions.
    
    <p>ModelSources can supply models in a variety of ways.
    
    <ul>
    <li>some fresh model of the kind this ModelSource supplies
    <li>the particular model this ModelSource supplies
    <li>a named model from the collection this ModelSource supplies
    </ul>
    
    ModelSources may choose to not implement certain aspects of the
    full interface, but must document which aspects are available.
