    An abstract base class for implementations of ModelSpec. It provides the base 
    functionality of providing a ModelMaker (different sub-classes use this for different
    purposes) and utility methods for reading and creating RDF descriptions. It also
    provides a value table associating freshly-constructed bnodes with arbitrary Java
    values, so program-constructed specifications can pass on database connections,
    actual document managers, and so forth.
