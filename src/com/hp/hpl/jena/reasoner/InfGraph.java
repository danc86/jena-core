 * are extract triples in the inferred graph and so appear through the
 * normal Graph.find interface. 
 * 
 * However, here are two extensions required. Firstly, the ability to
 * ask about global properties of the whole graph (e.g. consistency). Secondly,
 * the ability to temporarily construct expressions (encoded in RDF) which 
 * form more complex queries.
