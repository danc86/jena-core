/**
 * Reasoner configuration for the OWL micro reasoner.
 * This only supports:
 * <ul>
 * <li>RDFS entailments</li>
 * <li>basic OWL axioms like ObjectProperty subClassOf Property</li>
 * <li>intersectionOf, equivalentClass and forward implication of unionOf sufficient for traversal
 * of explicit class hierachies<.li>
 * <li>Property axioms (inversOf, SymmetricProperty, TransitiveProperty, equivalentProperty)</li>
 * </ul>
 * There is some experimental support for the cheaper class restriction handlingly which
 * should not be relied on at this point.
