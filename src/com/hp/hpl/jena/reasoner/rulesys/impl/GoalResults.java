 * is a table of partially evaluated goals. Each entry is an instance
 * of GoalResults which contains the goal (a generalized triple pattern
 * which supports structured literals), a set triple values, a completion
 * flag and a generator (which represents a continuation point for
 * finding further goal values). This is essentially an encapsulation of
 * the OR graph of the evaluation trace.
