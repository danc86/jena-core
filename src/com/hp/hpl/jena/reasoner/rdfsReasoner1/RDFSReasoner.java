/**
 * An RDFS reasoner suited to modest vocabularies but large instance
 * data. It does eager processing on the class and property declarations
 * and caches the results. This means that the initial creation can
 * be slow. However, if the vocabulary and instance data can be
 * separated then at least the class lattice results can be reused.
 * <p>
 * Instance related rules are implemented using a very simple rewrite
 * system. Triple queries that match a rule are rewritten and reapplied 
 * as queries. This is reasonably efficient for fairly ground queries,
 * especially where the predicate is ground. It performs redundant
 * passes over the data for unground queries, especially any that
 * need that might match (*, type, Resource) or (*, type, Property)!</p>
