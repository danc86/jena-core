/**
 * A  simple "reasoner" used to help with API development.
 * <p>This reasoner caches a transitive closure of the subClass and
 * subProperty graphs. The generated infGraph allows both the direct
 * and closed versions of these properties to be retrieved. The cache is
 * built when the tbox is bound in but if the final data graph
 * contains additional subProperty/subClass declarations then the
 * cache has to be rebuilt.</p>
 * <p>
 * The triples in the tbox (if present) will also be included
 * in any query. Any of tbox or data graph are allowed to be null.</p>
 * <p>
 * TODO: Add switch (in configuration code) to turn off meta-level enablement
 * of RDFS processing.</p>
