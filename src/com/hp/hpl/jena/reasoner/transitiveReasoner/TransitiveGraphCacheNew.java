/**
 * Datastructure used to represent a closed transitive reflexive relation.
 * It (mostly) incrementally maintains a transitive reduction and transitive
 * closure of the relationship and so queries should be faster than dynamically 
 * computing the closed or reduced relations.
 * <p>
 * The implementation stores the reduced and closed relations as real graph
 * (objects linked together by pointers). For each graph node we store its direct
 * predecessors and successors and its closed successors. A big cost penalty 
 * is the storage turnover involved in turning the graph representation back into 
 * triples to answer queries. We avoid this by optionally also storing the
 * manifested triples for the links. The storage cost thus
 * scales L^2 where L is the length of the relation chains (e.g. the depth in the
 * subClass hiearachy). This could be reduced by using interval indexes (Agrawal, 
 * Borigda and Jagadish 1989) at the cost of complicating incremental inserts 
 * and dynamic storage turnover.
 * </p><p>
 * Cycles are currently handled by collapsing strongly connected components.
 * Incremental deletes would be possible but at the price of substanially 
 * more storage and code complexity. We compromise by doing the easy cases
 * incrementally but some deletes (those that break strongly connected components)
 * will trigger a fresh rebuild.
