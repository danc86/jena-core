RDQL - A query language for Jena.
<p>
RDQL is an implementation of the
<a href="http://swordfish.rdfweb.org/rdfquery" target="_blank">SquishQL</a>
RDF query language, which itself is derived from
<a href="http://web1.guha.com/rdfdb/query.html" target="_blank">rdfDB</a>.
This class of query languages regards RDF as triple data, without schema or
ontology information unless explicitly includes in the RDF
source.  RDQL provides a query syntax and query execution engine in Java,
primarily for experimental and embedded applications.</p>
