 * A factory for providing instances of graphs with appropriate storage models. 
 * It is <b>not</b> part of the contract for this factory that each instance
 * is unique; some applications may legitimately want to write triples into
 * a single graph (such as a database). 
 * </p>
 * 
 * Updated by kers; added methods that create or locate named graphs.
