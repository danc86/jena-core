    PatternStageBase contains the features that are common to the 
    traditional PatternStage engine and the Faster engine. (Eventually
    the two will merge back together.) Notable, it:
    
    <ul>
    <li>remembers the graph 
    <li>classifies all the triples according to the factory
    <li>constructs the array of applicable guards
    </ul>
