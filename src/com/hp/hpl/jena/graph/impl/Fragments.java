    A <code>Fragments</code> object represents the incomplete or over-specified
    reification triples that have been asserted about some node. Rather than keeping 
    the triples, we keep the subject node (the one that has ref:subject etc properties) and sets of objects for
    each of the four relevant properties.

    See SimpleReifier for the use of Fragments. A longer and more
    explanatory name was considered for Fragments, but the effect of
    picking one of those seemed to make the code that *uses* them
