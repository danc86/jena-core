/**
    A _Fragments_ object represents the reification triples that have been
    asserted about some node. The triples may form an incomplete or
    inconsistent reification. They may even form a complete, single
    reification. Rather than keeping the triples, we keep the subject node
    (the one that has ref:subject etc properties) and sets of objects for
    each of the four relevant properties.
<p>
    See SimpleReifier for the use of Fragments. A longer and more
    explanatory name was considered for Fragments, but the effect of
    picking one of those seemed to make the code that *uses* them
    excessively verbose. 
<p>
    TODO: consider splitting .graph up to use sub-packages to
    express the structure more clearly.
