/**
    Abstract base class for testing graph factories. Subclasses define the
    method <code>getGraphFactory()</code> which supplies a new graph
    factory to be tested: ATGF invokes that during <code>setUp</code>
    and closes it in <code>tearDown</code>.
<p>
    This bunch of tests is not remotely exhaustive, but it was sufficent to
    drive the development of the first full graph factory. (Although at the time
    it wasn't abstract.)
