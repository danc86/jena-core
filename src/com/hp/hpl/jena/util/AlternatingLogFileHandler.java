/** A log file handler which write the log to a number of
 * files in a round robbin fashion.
 *
 * <p>This is a subclass of LogFileHandler, which instead of
 * writing all the log data to one file, will write <CODE>
 * numEntries</CODE> entries to one file, then the next <CODE>
 * numEntries</CODE> to another, continuing until <CODE>
 * numFiles</CODE> files have been written when it will start
 * again with the first file.</p>
 *
 * <p>The files are written according to a pattern:<p>
 * <CODE><PRE>
 *         fileNameRoot[N].fileNameExt
 * </PRE></CODE>
 *
 * <p>This log file handler is useful for long term logging
 * when the amount of log data generated is large, but only
 * the latest entries are of interest.</p>
