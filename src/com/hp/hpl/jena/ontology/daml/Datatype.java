/**
 * A Datatype, in the overall DAML ontology, represents values from concrete domains
 * that are not formalised as part of the DAML model theory.  In particular, the
 * category Datatype is disjoint from the category Class, so any value is either
 * typed as an instance of a class or of a datatype. XML Schema data descriptions
 * are used to encode the concrete domain of a datatype.  In general, we provide
 * a general mechanism for mapping between Java objects and datatype values,
 * propulated by a small sample of common cases from the XML schema specification.
 * However, this mechanism is extensible, so users can add additional mappings for
 * a given application.
