/**
 * Java encapsulation of an object property in a DAML ontology. An object property
 * is a partition of the class of properties, in which the range of the property
 * is a DAML instance (rather than a datatype). Object properties may be transitive
 * and unambiguous, which are modelled in the specification by sub-classes of
 * <code>ObjectProperty</code> named <code>TransitiveProperty</code> and
 * <code>UnambiguousProperty</code>.  In this API, transitivity and uniqueness are
 * modelled as attributes of the DAMLObjectProperty object.
