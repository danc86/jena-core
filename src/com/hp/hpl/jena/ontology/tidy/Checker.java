/**
 * 
 * This class implements the OWL Syntax Checker.
 * The basic mode of use, is to create a Checker
 * and to add one or more Models, OntModels or Graphs.
 * It tries to do the right thing, vis-a-vis
 * imports, without duplicating imports processing 
 * already performed by an OntModel.
 * The three methods {@link #getProblems()}
 * {@link #getErrors()} and {@link #getSubLanguage()}
 * can all be used repeatedly and at any point. They
 * report on what has been added so far.
 * When constructing a checker, you must choose whether
 * to record errors and problems concerning non-OWL Lite
 * constructs, or only concerning non-OWL DL constructs.
 * For either choice {@link #getSubLanguage()} functions
 * correctly (i.e. the grammar used is identical). However,
 * if the Checker has been constructed with the liteflag as false,
 * it is not possible to access a rationale for an ontology
 * being in OWL DL rather than OWL Lite.
