/**
 * Bit fields etc, used by {@link LookupTable}, both
 * internally and in the opaque key returned to 
 * {@link AbsChecker}
 * <p>
 * The integers in the main tables
 * have the following form:
 * <pre>
 * 31 30 29 28 27 26 25 24 23 22 21 20 19 18 17 16
 *  0 [*** SUBJECT **9 bits****] [* NEW SUBJ 6b *]
 * 
 * 15 14 13 12 11 10 09 08 07 06 05 04 03 02 01 00
 * [*NEW P] [*NEW OBJ 5b*] [** ACTION 8bits *****]
 * </pre>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * The *NEW SUBJ* id ranges from 1 to 46
 * <li>
 * The *NEW P* from 0 to 4
 * <li>
 * The *NEW OBJ* from 0 to 23
 * </ul>
 * NOTE: the new subj is counted from 1, the others from 0.
 * This is to ensure that at least one of the fields
 * other than SUBJECT is non-zero, which adds to uniformity
 * since we use (SUBJECT 0 0 0 0) as a key, which we
 * know is <em>not</em> in the array of values.
 * <p>
 * The NEW SUBJ, NEW OBJ and NEW PRED values
 * are used in conjuction with the old value
 * of these fields to select the new value.
 * <p>
 * These are the values passed between the 
 * AbsChecker and the LookupTable.
 * 
 * <p>
 * At the time of design there were the following
 * numeric facts:
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * just under 400 categories
 * <li>
 *  342 can be subjects
 * <li>
 * 
 *   52 can be predicates
 * <li>
 * 
 *  356 can be objects
 * <li>
 * 
 *  For each of the 52 predicates 
 *  the refinement selects one of at most 5 refined 
 * predicates
 * <li>
 * 
 *  For each of the 356 objects 
 *  the refinement selects on of at most 24 
 * refined objects (1 with 24, the others 14 or less)
 * <li>
 * 
 *  For each of the 342 subjects the refinement 
 * selects one of at most 46 refined subjects
 * (1 with 46 the others with 23 or less)
 * <li>
 * 
 * The action is in fact only 6 bits
 * (a 7th is planned)
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The compiler prints out these facts as it operates.
 * <p>
 * Theoretically it would be possible to compress a 
 * bit further ...
 * If we treated the subject with 46 refinements as
 * a special case, noting that 
 * 24*5*52*23*356*64 = 3269959680
 * which is less than 2^32 it would be
 * possible to pack a prop and object
 * and the new fields and the action into 4 bytes.
 * <p>
 * However, this is made difficult because:
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * the need for the special case subject
 * <li>
 * unsigned arithmetic in java is hard.
 * </ul>
 * Given that we have not got either the
 * object or the predicate in the 32 bits
 * we have to select on them earlier.
 * <p>
 * This makes the arrangement of the tables of data
 * as arrays somewhat complex, being
 * indexed by object and a prop-index
 * The appropriate prop-index is found by looking
 * for the property in an additional array
 * indexed by object (well, that was as clear as mud).
 * See the code of {@link LookupTable#qrefine} for details of the indexing,
 * that code is reasonably small, and should help elucidate.
 * <p>
 * The compiler must check that no field overflow
 * occurs. If the grammar changes and the current
 * limits prove insufficient, here are some areas
 * of slack:
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * it should be possible to use the top-bit
 *   (since we are using bitfields rather than
 *    % and /)
 *   However, given that essentially this would
 *   be using a signed int as if it were unsigned
 *   some care may be needed.
 * <li> the action field is currently only 6 bits
 *   the top two bits are unused (verify before
 *   modifying)
 * <li>one bit of the new subj field and one bit
 *   of the new obj field are used very rarely,
 *   an overflow mechanism could be used for 
 *   those rare cases - it would probably be best
 *   to correct the overflow in qrefine and
 *   then use the high bits of the key returned
 *   to AbsChecker for the return result.
 *   (the SUBJECT field is current set but not 
 *   actually needed in the return result of 
 *   qrefine).
 * </ul>
