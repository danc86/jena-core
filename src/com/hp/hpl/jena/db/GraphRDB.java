/**
 *
 * GraphRDB implementation
 * 
 * This graph stores data persistently in a relational database.
 * Most application developers should not need to interact directly
 * with GraphRDB, instead use ModelRDB.
 * 
 * Each GraphRDB keeps a list of specialized graphs.
 * 
 * For each operation, it works through the list of graphs
 * attempting to perform the operation on each one.
 * 
 * The intention is that each type of specialized graph is
 * optimized for a different type of triple.  For example, one
 * type of specialied graph might be optimized for storing
 * triples in a particular ontology.  The last specialized
 * graph in the list is always a generic one that can handle any
 * valid RDF triple.
 * 
 * The order of the specialied graphs is consistent and
 * immutable after the graph is constructed.  This aids 
 * optimization.  For example, if a specialied graph
 * is asked to perform an operatin on a triple, and it knows 
 * that it would have added it if asked, then it can advise the 
 * calling GraphRDB that the operaton is complete even though
 * it doesn't know anything about other specialized graphs later
 * in the list.
 * 
 * @since Jena 2.0
