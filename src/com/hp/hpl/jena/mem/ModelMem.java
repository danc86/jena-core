/** A main memory implemention of the RDF API.
 *
 * <p>This implementation of the RDF API stores its all its data in main memory.
 *   It supports all methods except the transaction calls.</p>
 * <p>This is a prototype implementation, and should be considered to be alpha
 *   quality code.  It has not yet been performance optimised and is known to be
 *   wasteful of memory.  It has been tested by loading the wordnet database
 *   (see Sample3) which results in a model containing over 600,000 statements.
