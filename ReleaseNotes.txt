Release Notes
=============

Jena 2.0 (August 2003)

This is Jena 2.0.  This version follows on from preview and beta releases
and is the first full release of Jena2.

Most functionality from Jena1 (core RDF API, readers and writers for
RDF/XML, N-Triples and N3,together with RDQL) is provided in Jena2 although
no BerkeleyDB persistence is currently provided.  Jena2 adds new
functionality with an ontology API, including OWL, a reasoner plug-in
architecture together with rule-based reasoners for RDFS and OWL.

The jar file "antlr.debug.jar" has been replaced by "antlr.jar".

1) Fastpath is enabled.
2) URI prefix compression is implemented.
3) Configuration and access options are exposed to applications through get/set methods.
4) The prefix for database table names may be redefined.
5) Oracle is now fully supported.
6) New factory methods for persistent models are available, deprecating the existing ModelRDB constructors.
