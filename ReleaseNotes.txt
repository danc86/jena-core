In this release:

RDQL:
+ support for datatypes and language tags on literals based on the 
  N-Triples syntax.  e.g. "123"^^xsd:integer
+ all commas in queries are optional
+ qnames do not need to be quoted by <>
+ Standard namespace built-in: rdf:, rdfs:, owl:, xsd:  An application
  may override these with explicit declarations.
+ Uses the SPI-level query mechansism - this is preparation for 
  improved performance with relational databases.
