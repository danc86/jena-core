Release Notes
=============

Jena 2.1-dev-1:
  This is a developers' release, particularly
  intended for users of the OWL Syntax Checker.
  Most users should continue to use Jena 2.0.
  For changes, see directly below.
  Documentation may not be up to date.
  Do not use this version unless:
  - you need a conformant OWL Syntax Checker
  - you need one or more of the bug fixes not in
    Jena 2.0


RDF API:
o Bug fixes:
  - fixed issue with typed literals sometimes treating lexically different,
    sameValueAs resources as equal.

  - fixed bug in Model::remove(StmtIterator) at the expense of manifesting
    the iterator into a List

  - fixed bug in .remove on StmtIterators returned from listStatements()
    on a memory model

o ModelFactory improvements:
  - ModelSpecs can now be identified by URI as well as Model values

Reasoner subsystem:

o Extended OWL rules to include more explicit representation of XSD knowledge.
o Various bug fixes in OWL rules (maxCardinality bug, hasValue in intersection
  lists fixed, bug in someValuesFrom fixed, misssing property subclass axioms).
o Fixed bug in RETE engine which could loop when deleting non-deletable triples.
o Fixed bug in LP engine which could lead to loss of variable bindings
  (manifested as "Internal error in LP reasoner: variable in triple result")

OWL Syntax Checker
o Now conforms with OWL Candidate Rec of August 2003
  - There are minor differences with other conformant
    syntax checkers. These are being addressed during the
    OWL CR period.
  - Performance has not yet been addressed. There is
    a two or three second delay on start-up.

Graph query SPI [NB NOT visible at the model level]

o replaced use of Graph for constraints by new Expression interface as
  part of ongoing query improvement.

Jena 2.0 (August 2003)

This is Jena 2.0.  This version follows on from preview and beta releases
and is the first full release of Jena2.

Most functionality from Jena1 (core RDF API, readers and writers for
RDF/XML, N-Triples and N3,together with RDQL) is provided in Jena2 although
no BerkeleyDB persistence is currently provided.  Jena2 adds new
functionality with an ontology API, including OWL, a reasoner plug-in
architecture together with rule-based reasoners for RDFS and OWL.

Release Notes
=============

Changes from Jena2-beta1:

The jar file "antlr.debug.jar" has been replaced by "antlr.jar".


Persistent Storage:

1) Fastpath is enabled.
2) URI prefix compression is implemented.
3) Configuration and access options are exposed to applications through
   get/set methods.
4) The prefix for database table names may be redefined.
5) Oracle is now fully supported.
6) New factory methods for persistent models are available, deprecating
   the existing ModelRDB constructors.

Reasoning subsystem:
1) Replaced the backward chaining reasoner by a more stable, more space
   efficient LP engine (loosely based on SLG-WAM).
2) Updated the RDFS rule sets as a result, with x2 speed improvement on
   test data.
3) Updated the OWL rule set to be more complete, fix all reported bugs, add
   support for hasValue. More development still required.
4) Added a mechanism for rule-based validation and added validation rules to
   the OWL rule set.
5) Replaced the documentation completely.
6) Fixed various misc bugs report on jena-dev and CVS - many thanks to all
   those took to time to report these problems.

RDF API:
1) Replaced the createTypedLiteral calls with versions that do not allow
   xml:lang tags, in keeping with working group changes.
   Deprecated the version of createLiteral that takes both xml:lang and
xml:wellFormed.



PrefixMappings. Jena models maintain a mapping from namespace
prefixes to namespaces. This mapping is updated when models are
read, and used when models are written. Jena code can query and
update these mappings freely.

Event listeners. Listeners can be attached to models and are notified
when triples are added to or removed from the model, singly or in
bulk.

Reification. Jena optimises the storage of complete reified statements, and
provides classes and methods for manipulating ReifiedStatement objects. By
default, the treatment of reified statments is in accordance with the
latest Working Group specifications.

Model construction. Models can be constructed in memory or in
relational databases. Memory-based models may be reflected in
files. Models can be named and held in clusters using ModelMakers.
